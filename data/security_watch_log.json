This includes the FriendlyELEC Core4418, NanoPi2 and Fire2A SBCs, Samsung Artik 530 modules, and several others.

It is based on Espressif ESP32-D0WDR2-V3 and Silicon Labs EFR32MG24 SoCs, and can serve as both a Zigbee coordinator and Thread Border Router, with connectivity options including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and USB. The dongle is specifically designed for popular smart home platforms like Home Assistant, Zigbee2MQTT, ioBroker, and OpenHAB. Key advantages of the Dongle Max over the recently reviewed Dongle Plus MG24 include built-in Wi-Fi and Ethernet support (in addition to USB), Power over Ethernet (PoE), and a convenient Web Console for easier device configuration. It basically provides more flexibility thanks to a wider range of connection options, and it&#8217;s easier to place it in strategic locations since it doesn&#8217;t need to be connected directly to your Home Assistant server.

But were do I even begin with this one? Okay, so, first of all, you need to know that [Kai Ruhl] built <a href=\"https://land-of-kain.de/docs/keyboard/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an amazing split keyboard</a> with plenty of keys for even someone like me. Be sure to check it out, because the build log is great reading.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_905101\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/keymouse.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A lovely split keyboard on a pair of rails that doubles as a mouse. \" class=\"wp-image-905101 size-medium\" height=\"246\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/keymouse.png?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-905101\">Image by [Kai Ruhl] via <a href=\"https://land-of-kain.de/docs/rollermouse/\" target=\"_blank\">Land of Kain</a></figcaption></figure>But that wasn&#8217;t enough &#8212; a mousing solution was in order that didn&#8217;t require taking [Kai]&#8217;s hands off of the keyboard. And so, over the course of several months, <a href=\"https://land-of-kain.de/docs/rollermouse/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the RollerMouse Keyboard</a> came into being. That&#8217;s the creation you see here.</p>\n<p>Essentially, this is an ortholinear split with a built-in roller bar mouse, which basically acts like a cylindrical trackball. There&#8217;s an outer pipe that slides left/right and rolls up and down, and this sits on a stationary inner rod. The actual mouse bit is from a Logitech M-BJ69 optical number.</p>\n<p>[Kai] found it unpleasant to work the roller bar using thumbs, so mousing is done via the palm rests. You may find it somewhat unpolished with all that exposed wiring in the middle. But I don&#8217;t. I just worry about dust is all. And like, wires getting ripped out accidentally.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-904804\"></span></p>\n<h2>All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy</h2>\n<p>As I write this, a terrible snowpocalypse is snuggling up to the southern and mid-western states. What a time to watch The Shining and <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1qeeqb4/prototype_dullboy/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out the dullboy prototype</a> by [Blind_Heim].</p>\n<p><figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_905102\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dullboy.jpeg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-905102 size-medium\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dullboy.jpeg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-905102\">Image by [Blind_Heim] via <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1qeeqb4/prototype_dullboy/\" target=\"_blank\">reddit</a></figcaption></figure>This is [Blind_Heim]&#8217;s first project, and I think it looks mighty fine, especially with those slanty thumb keys. They are [Blind_Heim]&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.printables.com/model/1507071-work-in-progress-adler-typewriter-keys-chocv1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">own creation</a> and were inspired by the design of the 1959 Adler Universal featured in <em>The</em> <em>Shining</em>. (Hence the name of the keyboard.) In case it isn&#8217;t obvious, they are meant for Kailh choc v1 switches.</p>\n<p>Rev 1 shown here has a nice!nano and supports v1 chocs only. Rev 2 will support v1 and v2, and will have a 40 mm Cirque trackpad in that middle space there. Rev 2 will also be open-source and entirely free of copyright, so watch out for that.</p>\n<p>Regarding those thumb keys, [Blind_Heim] says that they wanted something ergonomic and monoblock at first, and so the angles were just for looks. But after using it, he realized they were actually quite useful when it comes to determining which key is which without having to look.</p>\n<h2>The Centerfold: Downtown Busy Town Is the Place to Be</h2>\n<p><figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_905107\" style=\"width: 800px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/busy-town.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A colorful rectangle on a busy town desk mat. \" class=\"wp-image-905107 size-large\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/busy-town.png?w=800\" width=\"800\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-905107\">Image by [OrinNY] via <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1qbtaya/a_little_bit_of_color_to_brighten_your_day/\" target=\"_blank\">reddit</a></figcaption></figure><a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1qbtaya/a_little_bit_of_color_to_brighten_your_day/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">This desk mat</a> ought to bring back some memories.

There are nine U-shaped type bars: four on each side beneath the carriage, and one in the middle that swings up from behind.</p>\n<p>Each of these type bars holds eight characters, and these are selected by moving a wire up and down the index card using that giant round selector button the left side.

I think it&#8217;s built for whatever you want to use it for. It will be available in April.

[konkop] has a solution to these woes we&#8217;ve not seen before, <a href=\"https://github.com/konkop/ESP32-S3-USB-HID-Macro-Keyboard-Web-Typing-Interface\" target=\"_blank\">turning an ESP32-S3 into a USB HID keyboard</a> with a web interface for typing and some physical keyboard macro buttons. Instead of typing on the thing, you connect to it via WiFi using your phone, tablet, or computer, and type into a web browser. Your typing is then relayed to the USB HID interface.</p>\n<p>The full hardware and software for the design is in the GitHub repository. The macro buttons use Cherry MX keys, and are mapped by default to the common control sequences that most of us would find useful. The software uses Visual Studio Code, and PlatformIO.</p>\n<p>We like this project, because it solves something we&#8217;ve all encountered at one time or another, and it does so in a novel way. Yes, typing on a smartphone screen can be just as annoying as doing so with a fiddly rubber keyboard, but at least many of us already have our smartphones to hand. <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2020/02/29/a-mini-usb-keyboard-that-isnt-a-keyboard/\">Previous plug-in keyboard dongles</a> haven&#8217;t reached this ease of use.</p>"

As a Brit I remarked that it would look a bit silly were I were to only feature parts made in dear old Blighty &#8212; yes, we do still make some semiconductors! &#8212; and it made more sense to feature cool parts wherever I found them. But it left me musing about the nature of semiconductors, and whether it&#8217;s possible for any of them to truly only come from one country. So here follows a much more functional <em>I, Chip</em> than Read&#8217;s original, trying to work out just where your integrated circuit really comes from. It almost certainly takes great liberties with the details of the processes involved, but the countries of manufacture and extraction are accurate.</p>\n<h2>First, There&#8217;s The Silicon</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914714\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12-inch_silicon_wafer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A mirror-like disc of silicon, with visible IC patterns and a rainbow pattern from diffraction.\" class=\"wp-image-914714 size-medium\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12-inch_silicon_wafer.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914714\">A silicon wafer, here bearing a grid of integrated circuits. Peellden, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:12-inch_silicon_wafer.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An integrated circuit, or silicon chip, is as its name suggests, made of silicon. Silicon is all around us in rocks and minerals, as silicon dioxide, which we know in impure form as sand. The world&#8217;s largest producer of silicon metal is China, followed by Russia, then Brazil. So if China and Russia are off the table then somewhere in Brazil, a Korean-made continuous bucket excavator scoops up some sand from a quarry.</p>\n<p>That sand is taken to a smelting plant and fed with some carbon, probably petroleum coke as a by-product from a Brazilian oil refinery, into a Taiwanese-made submerged-arc furnace. The smelting plant produces ingots of impure silicon, which are shipped to a wafer plant in Taiwan. There they pass through a German-made zone refining process to produce the ultra-pure silicon which is split into wafers. Taiwan is a global centre for semiconductor foundries so the wafers could be shipped locally, but our chip is going to be made in the USA. They&#8217;re packed in a carton made from Canadian wood pulp, and placed in a container on a Korean-made ship bound for an American port. There it&#8217;s unloaded by a German-made container handling crane, and placed on a truck for transport to the foundry. The truck is American, made in the great state of Washington.</p>\n<h2>Then, There&#8217;s The Package And Leads</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_914715\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TQFP_Leadframe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"A copper sheet cut into a spiders-web-like pattern of copper fingers, which converge on the square space in the centre where the chip will go.\" class=\"wp-image-914715 size-medium\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TQFP_Leadframe.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914715\">Lead frames for TQFP integrated circuits. I, NobbiP, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TQFP_Leadframe.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Our integrated circuit is the chip itself, but in most cases it&#8217;s not just the bare chip. It&#8217;s supplied potted in an epoxy case, and with its contacts brought out to some kind of pins. The epoxy is a petrochemical product, while the lead frame is either stamped or chemically etched from metal sheet and plated.</p>\n<p>So, somewhere in the Chilean Atacama desert, an American-made dragline excavator is digging out copper ore from the bottom of a huge pit. The ore is loaded into Japanese-made dump trucks, from where it&#8217;s driven to a rail head and loaded into ore carrier cars. The American-made locomotives take it to a refining plant where machinery installed by a Finnish company smelts and refines it into copper ingots. These are shipped to Sweden aboard a German-made ship, unloaded by a German-made crane, and delivered to a specialised metal refiner on a Swedish-made truck.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914716\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NE555_DIP__SOIC.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Two NE555 intgrated circuits, one in a DIP-8 package, the other in an SOIC package.\" class=\"wp-image-914716 size-medium\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NE555_DIP__SOIC.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914716\">You all know the 555.

At the nickel refining plant, which is Canadian-made, the sulphur and iron impurities are removed, and the resulting nickel ingots travel by rail behind a Canadian-made (but American designed) locomotive to a port, where an American made crane loads them into an Italian-made ship bound for Sweden. Another German crane and Swedish truck deliver it to the metal refiner, where a Swedish-made plant is used to create a copper-nickel alloy.</p>\n<p>A German-made rolling plant then turns the alloy into a thin sheet, shipped in a roll inside a container on a Japanese-made container ship bound for the USA. Eventually after another round of cranes, trains, and trucks, all American this time, it arrives at the company who makes lead frames. They use a Japanese-made machine to stamp the sheet alloy and create the frames themselves. An American-made truck delivers them to the chip foundry.</p>\n<p>At a petrochemical plant in China, bulk epoxy resin, plasticisers, pigments, and other products are manufactured. They are supplied in drums, which are shipped on a Chinese-made container ship to an American port where American cranes and trucks do the job of delivering them to an epoxy formulation company. There they are mixed in carefully-selected proportions to produce American-made epoxy semiconductor moulding compound, which is delivered to the chip foundry on an American-made truck.</p>\n<h2>Bringing all Those Countries&#8217; Parts Together</h2>\n<p>The foundry now has the silicon wafers, lead frames, and epoxy it needs to make an integrated circuit. There are many other chemicals used in its process, but for simplicity we&#8217;ll take those three as being the parts which make an IC. What they don&#8217;t yet have is an integrated circuit to make. For that there&#8217;s a team of high-end engineers in a smart air-conditioned office of an American semiconductor company in California. They are integrated circuit designers, but they don&#8217;t design everything. Instead they buy in much of the circuit as intellectual property, which can come from a variety of different countries. Banging the drum as a Brit I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all know that ARM cores come from Cambridge here in the UK, just to name the most obvious example. So British, German, Dutch, American, and Canadian IP is combined using American software and the knowledge of American engineers, and the resulting design is sent to the foundry.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914720\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aerial_photograph_of_Globalfoundries_Dresden.jpg\"><img alt=\"An aerial view of a very large factory surrounded by farmland\" class=\"wp-image-914720 size-medium\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aerial_photograph_of_Globalfoundries_Dresden.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914720\">This is the Globalfoundries semiconductor plant in Dresden, Germany. Fensterblick., <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aerial_photograph_of_Globalfoundries_Dresden.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The process machinery of an integrated circuit foundry lies probably at the most bleeding edge of human technology. The machines this foundry uses are mostly from Eindhoven in the Netherlands, but they are joined by American, German, Japanese, and even British ones. Even then, those machines themselves contain high-precision parts from all those countries and more, so that Dutch machine is also in part American and German too.</p>\n<p>Whatever magic the semiconductor foundry does is performed, and at the loading bay appear cartons made from Canadian wood pulp containing reels made from Chinese bulk polymer, that have hundreds of packaged American-made integrated circuits in them. Some of them are shipped on an American truck to an airport, from where they cross the Atlantic in the hold of a pan-European-manufactured jet aircraft to be shipped from the British airport in a German-made truck to an electronics distributor in Northamptonshire. I place an order, and the next day a Polish bloke driving an American-badged van that was made in Turkey delivers a few of them to my door.</p>\n<p>The above path from a dusty quarry in Brazil to my front door in Oxfordshire is excessively simplified, and were you to really try to find every possible global contribution it&#8217;s likely there would be few countries left out and this document would be hundreds of pages long. I hope mining engineers, metallurgists, chemists, and semiconductor process engineers will forgive me for any omissions or errors. What I hope it does illustrate though is how connected the world of manufacturing is, and how many sources come together to produce a single product. Read&#8217;s 1958 pencil is alive and well.</p>"

Hence he jumped on the opportunity to source a Pico 2 clone board with the same MCU but with a USB-C connector from AliExpress. After receiving the new board, he set about <a href=\"https://pfister.dev/blog/2026/pico2-clone.html\" target=\"_blank\">comparing the two</a> to see whether the clone board was worth it after all. In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxgPmbocAF4\" target=\"_blank\">accompanying video</a> you can get even more details on why you should avoid this particular clone board.</p>\n<p>In the video the respective components of both boards are analyzed and compared to see how they stack up. The worst issues with the clone Pico 2 board are an improper USB trace impedance at 130 Ω with also a cut ground plane below it that won&#8217;t do signal integrity any favors.</p>\n<p>There is also an issue with the buck converter routing for the RP2350 with an unconnected pin (VREG_FB) despite the recommended layout in the RP2350 datasheet. Power supply issues continue with the used LN3440 DC-DC converter which can source 800 mA instead of the 1A of the Pico 2 version and performed rather poorly during load tests, with one board dying at 800 mA load.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-908616\"></span></p>\n<p></p>"

Dead and gone, you might think, but even they have dedicated enthusiasts here in 2026. Some of them have gone so far as <a href=\"https://www.avalibeyaz.com/s3/\" target=\"_blank\">to produce a new ROM</a> for the daddy of Symbian phones, the Nokia N8, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyVjWu4T0eU\" target=\"_blank\">[Janus Cycle] is giving it a spin</a>.</p>\n<p>For many people, the smartphone era began when the first Apple iPhones and Android devices reached the market, but the smartphone itself can be traced back almost two decades earlier to an IBM device. In the few years before the birth of today&#8217;s platforms many people even had smartphones without quite realizing what they had, because Nokia, the market leader in the 2000s, failed to make their Symbian platform user friendly in the way that Apple did. The N8 was their attempt to produce an iPhone competitor, but its lack of an on-device app store and that horrific Windows-based installation system meant it would be their last mass-market flagship before falling down the Microsoft Windows Phone rabbit hole.</p>\n<p>In the video below the break he takes a pair of N8s and assembles one with that beautiful camera fully working, before installing the new ROM and giving it a spin. We get to see at last what the N8 could have been but wasn&#8217;t, as it gains the last Symbian release from Nokia, and the crucial missing app store. Even fifteen years later it&#8217;s a very slick device, enough to make us sorry that this ROM won&#8217;t be made for the earlier N-series sitting in a drawer where this is being written. We salute its developers for keeping the N8 alive.</p>\n<p>Oddly, <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2022/01/27/an-up-to-date-development-environment-for-the-nokia-n-gage/\">this isn&#8217;t the only Nokia from that era that&#8217;s received a little 2020s love</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-914693\"></span></p>\n<p></p>"

If you&#8217;re a fan of the machine and want to revisit its glory days, you could hunt one down on an auction site and hope that it&#8217;s in working order. Or you could just emulate the VIC-20 in your browser <a href=\"https://vic20.games/\" target=\"_blank\">thanks to the work of [Lance Ewing].</a></p>\n<p>The project is called JVic—because it&#8217;s a VIC-20 emulator written in Java. It&#8217;s primarily intended for playing old VIC-20 games, and is designed with mobile devices front of mind—so it works well on a phone screen. You can enjoy the built-in library of games, or you can even direct JVic to boot up a ROM from a ZIP file hosted on a given URL or attached to a forum post. You can also install it on your own device rather than running it online, if so desired. [Lance] provides a range of setup options for running it locally or putting it on your own web server if that&#8217;s how you like to do things. Files are <a href=\"https://github.com/lanceewing/jvic\" target=\"_blank\">on Github</a> for those eager to dive in.</p>\n<p>We get lots of VIC-20 hacks around these parts. Even if it&#8217;s not the most popular machine that Commodore ever built, it&#8217;s certainly up there in the rankings. <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2023/11/03/learn-forth-on-the-commodore-vic-20/\">If you want to learn Forth</a>, or even <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2023/01/25/new-commodore-vic-20-build/\">build a VIC-20 from scratch</a>, we&#8217;ve explored that before. If you&#8217;ve got your own retrocomputer hacks kicking around, don&#8217;t hesitate to <a href=\"http://hackaday.com/submit-a-tip\">let us know</a>!</p>\n<p>[Thanks to Stephen Walters for the tip!]</p>"

For this to work it is however essential to have exact timing and other relevant information to accurately match the signals from each individual radio telescope. As VLBI is used for increasingly higher ranges and bandwidths this makes synchronizing the signals much harder, but an optical frequency comb technique <a href=\"https://www.laserfocusworld.com/lasers-sources/article/55353332/radio-telescopes-benefit-from-ultraprecise-optical-frequency-combs\" target=\"_blank\">may offer a solution here</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-025-02056-w\" target=\"_blank\">the paper</a> by [Minji Hyun] et al. it&#8217;s detailed how they built the system and used it with the Korean VLBI Network (VLB) Yonsei radio telescope in Seoul as a proof of concept. This still uses the same hydrogen maser atomic clock as timing source, but with the optical transmission of the pulses a higher accuracy can be achieved, limited only by the photodiode on the receiving end.</p>\n<p>In the demonstration up to 50 GHz was possible, but commercial 100 GHz photodiodes are available. It&#8217;s also possible to send additional signals via the fiber on different wavelengths for further functionality, all with the ultimately goal of better timing and adjustment for e.g. atmospheric fluctuations that can affect radio observations.</p>"

Some victims reportedly are paying &#8212; perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a &#8220;We&#8217;re not paying&#8221; response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group&#8217;s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73160\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73160\" height=\"746\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/dontfeed.png\" width=\"748\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73160\">Image: Shutterstock.com, @Mungujakisa</p></div>\n<p>Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s according to <strong>Allison Nixon</strong>, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy <a href=\"https://unit221b.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unit 221B</a>. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they&#8217;ll do &#8212; such as destroying stolen data.</p>\n<p>Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that &#8212; to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim&#8217;s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns.</p>\n<p>SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/expansion-shinyhunters-saas-data-theft\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a January 30 blog post</a>, Google&#8217;s security forensics firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> said SLSH&#8217;s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,&#8221; the blog post explained.</p>\n<p>Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay.</p>\n<p>Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to &#8220;swatting&#8221; attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target&#8217;s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A big part of what they&#8217;re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives&#8217; kids and threatening the board of the company,&#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;And while these victims are getting extortion demands, they&#8217;re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, &#8216;Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we&#8217;re going to write about you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.unit221b.com/dont-read-this-blog/harassment-scare-tactics-why-victims-should-never-pay-shinyhunters\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post today</a>, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH&#8217;s known members hail from <strong>The Com</strong>, shorthand for a constellation of cybercrime-focused Discord and Telegram communities which serve as a kind of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">distributed social network that facilitates instant collaboration</a>.</p>\n<p>Nixon said Com-based extortion groups tend to instigate feuds and drama between group members, leading to lying, betrayals, credibility destroying behavior, backstabbing, and sabotaging each other.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With this type of ongoing dysfunction, often compounding by substance abuse, these threat actors often aren’t able to act with the core goal in mind of completing a successful, strategic ransom operation,&#8221; Nixon wrote. &#8220;They continually lose control with outbursts that put their strategy and operational security at risk, which severely limits their ability to build a professional, scalable, and sophisticated criminal organization network for continued successful ransoms &#8211; unlike other, more tenured and professional criminal organizations focused on ransomware alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Intrusions from established ransomware groups typically center around encryption/decryption malware that mostly stays on the affected machine. In contrast, Nixon said, ransom from a Com group is often structured the same as violent sextortion schemes against minors, wherein members of The Com will steal damaging information, threaten to release it, and &#8220;promise&#8221; to delete it if the victim complies without any guarantee or technical proof point that they will keep their word. She writes:</p>\n<p>A key component of SLSH&#8217;s efforts to convince victims to pay, Nixon said, involves manipulating the media into hyping the threat posed by this group. This approach also borrows a page from the playbook of sextortion attacks, she said, which encourages predators to keep targets continuously engaged and worrying about the consequences of non-compliance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On days where SLSH had no substantial criminal ‘win’ to announce, they focused on announcing death threats and harassment to keep law enforcement, journalists, and cybercrime industry professionals focused on this group,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73163\" style=\"width: 758px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73163\" height=\"92\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/comtutsh.png\" width=\"748\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73163\">An excerpt from a sextortion tutorial from a Com-based Telegram channel. Image: Unit 221B.</p></div>\n<p>Nixon knows a thing or two about being threatened by SLSH: For the past several months, the group&#8217;s Telegram channels have been replete with threats of physical violence against her, against Yours Truly, and against other security researchers. These threats, she said, are just another way the group seeks to generate media attention and achieve a veneer of credibility, but they are useful as indicators of compromise because SLSH members tend to name drop and malign security researchers even in their communications with victims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Watch for the following behaviors in their communications to you or their public statements,&#8221; Unit 221B&#8217;s advisory reads. &#8220;Repeated abusive mentions of Allison Nixon (or &#8220;A.N&#8221;), Unit 221B, or cybersecurity journalists—especially Brian Krebs—or any other cybersecurity employee, or cybersecurity company. Any threats to kill, or commit terrorism, or violence against internal employees, cybersecurity employees, investigators, and journalists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unit 221B says that while the pressure campaign during an extortion attempt may be traumatizing to employees, executives, and their family members, entering into drawn-out negotiations with SLSH incentivizes the group to increase the level of harm and risk, which could include the physical safety of employees and their families.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The breached data will never go back to the way it was, but we can assure you that the harassment will end,&#8221; Nixon said. &#8220;So, your decision to pay should be a separate issue from the harassment. We believe that when you separate these issues, you will objectively see that the best course of action to protect your interests, in both the short and long term, is to refuse payment.&#8221;</p>"

In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466.22.0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants accused of operating Badbox 2.0, which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said Badbox 2.0, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June 2025 advisory</a> from the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors — usually during the set-up process.</p>\n<p>The FBI said Badbox 2.0 was discovered after <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/trojans-all-the-way-down-badbox-and-peachpit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the original Badbox campaign</a> was disrupted in 2024. The original Badbox was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices (TV boxes) that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity was initially skeptical of the claim that the Kimwolf botmasters had hacked the Badbox 2.0 botnet.

The botmasters figured out they could trick residential proxy services into relaying malicious commands to vulnerable devices behind the firewall on the unsuspecting user&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>The vulnerable systems sought out by Kimwolf are primarily Internet of Things (IoT) devices like unsanctioned Android TV boxes and digital photo frames that have no discernible security or authentication built-in. Put simply, if you can communicate with these devices, you can compromise them with a single command.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">January 2 story</a> featured <a href=\"https://synthient.com/blog/a-broken-system-fueling-botnets\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> from the proxy-tracking firm <strong>Synthient</strong>, which alerted 11 different residential proxy providers that their proxy endpoints were vulnerable to being abused for this kind of local network probing and exploitation.</p>\n<p>Most of those vulnerable proxy providers have since taken steps to prevent customers from going upstream into the local networks of residential proxy endpoints, and it appeared that Kimwolf would no longer be able to quickly spread to millions of devices simply by exploiting some residential proxy provider.</p>\n<p>However, the source of that Badbox 2.0 screenshot said the Kimwolf botmasters had an ace up their sleeve the whole time: Secret access to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Dort has gotten unauthorized access,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;So, what happened is normal proxy providers patched this. But Badbox doesn&#8217;t sell proxies by itself, so it&#8217;s not patched. And as long as Dort has access to Badbox, they would be able to load&#8221; the Kimwolf malware directly onto TV boxes associated with Badbox 2.0.</p>\n<p>The source said it isn&#8217;t clear how Dort gained access to the Badbox botnet panel. But it&#8217;s unlikely that Dort&#8217;s existing account will persist for much longer: All of our notifications to the qq.com email addresses listed in the control panel screenshot received a copy of that image, as well as questions about the apparently rogue ABCD account.</p>"

Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one&#8217;s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns one&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic &#8212; including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping.</p>\n<p>Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">forward malicious commands</a> to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint&#8217;s local network.</p>\n<p>Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf&#8217;s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices &#8212; not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices &#8212; and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee.</p>\n<p>However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What&#8217;s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware.</p>\n<p>While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73086\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73086\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ipidea2023.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73086\">A screenshot of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy service.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf&#8217;s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we&#8217;d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> said a recent review of its customer traffic found <em>nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025</em>, when the botnet first showed signs of life.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,&#8221; Infoblox <a href=\"https://www.infoblox.com/blog/threat-intelligence/kimwolf-howls-from-inside-the-enterprise/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>. &#8220;Such a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.&#8221;<span id=\"more-73065\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Synthient</strong>, a startup that tracks proxy services and was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/the-kimwolf-botnet-is-stalking-your-local-network/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the first to disclose on January 2</a> the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government networks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73093\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73093\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/top50targetedomains.jpeg\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73093\">The top 50 domain names sought out by users of IPIDEA&#8217;s residential proxy service, according to Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>In a webinar on January 16, experts at the proxy tracking service <strong>Spur</strong> profiled Internet addresses associated with IPIDEA and 10 other proxy services that were thought to be vulnerable to Kimwolf&#8217;s tricks. Spur found residential proxies in nearly 300 government owned and operated networks, 318 utility companies, 166 healthcare companies or hospitals, and 141 companies in banking and finance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I looked at the 298 [government] owned and operated [networks], and so many of them were DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], which is kind of terrifying that DoD has IPIDEA and these other proxy services located inside of it,&#8221; Spur Co-Founder <strong>Riley Kilmer</strong> said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how these enterprises have these networks set up. It could be that [infected devices] are segregated on the network, that even if you had local access it doesn&#8217;t really mean much. However, it&#8217;s something to be aware of. If a device goes in, anything that device has access to the proxy would have access to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kilmer said Kimwolf demonstrates how a single residential proxy infection can quickly lead to bigger problems for organizations that are harboring unsecured devices behind their firewalls, noting that proxy services present a potentially simple way for attackers to probe other devices on the local network of a targeted organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you know you have [proxy] infections that are located in a company, you can chose that [network] to come out of and then locally pivot,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;If you have an idea of where to start or look, now you have a foothold in a company or an enterprise based on just that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is the third story in our series on the Kimwolf botnet.

As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong>, vice president of product management at <strong>Ivanti</strong>, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its &#8220;Important&#8221; rating and relatively low CVSS score.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Among the critical flaws patched this month are two <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> remote code execution bugs (<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20952\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20952</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-20953\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-20953</a>) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane.</p>\n<p>Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/patch-tuesday-october-2025-end-of-10-edition/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;End of 10&#8221; roundup</a> noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> at <strong>Rapid7</strong> said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2023-31096\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-31096</a>.<span id=\"more-73059\"></span></p>\n<p>&#8220;That’s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Today’s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying &#8220;living off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although Microsoft doesn’t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;In case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called attention to <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2026-21265\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2026-21265</a>, which is a critical Security Feature Bypass vulnerability affecting Windows Secure Boot. This security feature is designed to protect against threats like rootkits and bootkits, and it relies on a set of certificates that are set to expire in June 2026 and October 2026. Once these 2011 certificates expire, Windows devices that do not have the new 2023 certificates can no longer receive Secure Boot security fixes.</p>\n<p>Barnett cautioned that when updating the bootloader and BIOS, it is essential to prepare fully ahead of time for the specific OS and BIOS combination you’re working with, since incorrect remediation steps can lead to an unbootable system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Fifteen years is a very long time indeed in information security, but the clock is running out on the Microsoft root certificates which have been signing essentially everything in the Secure Boot ecosystem since the days of Stuxnet,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Microsoft issued replacement certificates back in 2023, alongside CVE-2023-24932 which covered relevant Windows patches as well as subsequent steps to remediate the Secure Boot bypass exploited by the BlackLotus bootkit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goettl noted that <strong>Mozilla</strong> has released updates for <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>Firefox ESR</strong> resolving a total of 34 vulnerabilities, two of which are suspected to be exploited (CVE-2026-0891 and CVE-2026-0892). Both are resolved in Firefox 147 (MFSA2026-01) and CVE-2026-0891 is resolved in Firefox ESR 140.7 (MFSA2026-03).</p>\n<p>&#8220;Expect <strong>Google Chrome</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> updates this week in addition to a high severity vulnerability in Chrome WebView that was resolved in the January 6 Chrome update (CVE-2026-0628),&#8221; Goettl said.</p>\n<p>As ever, the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/January%202026%20Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20Summary/32624/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a per-patch breakdown by severity and urgency.

Today, we&#8217;ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf&#8217;s spread.</p>\n<p>On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm <strong>XLab</strong> published <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/jsalton@keepersecurity.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a deep dive on Kimwolf</a>, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; services.</p>\n<p>The software that turns one&#8217;s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than a thousand different models</a> of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy&#8217;s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping.</p>\n<p>The XLab report explained its researchers found &#8220;definitive evidence&#8221; that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the <strong>Aisuru botnet </strong>&#8212; an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services.</p>\n<p>XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at <strong>93.95.112[.]59</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73024\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73024\" height=\"661\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/XLab-resito.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73024\">Image: XLab.</p></div>\n<h2>RESI RACK</h2>\n<p>Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based <strong>Resi Rack LLC</strong>. Resi Rack&#8217;s website bills the company as a &#8220;Premium Game Server Hosting Provider.&#8221; Meanwhile, Resi Rack&#8217;s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum <strong>BlackHatWorld</strong> refer to it as a &#8220;Premium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Resi Rack co-founder <strong>Cassidy Hales</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network &#8220;that detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,&#8221; Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. &#8220;This is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s radar more than two weeks before that. <strong>Benjamin Brundage</strong> is founder of <a href=\"https://synthient.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Synthient</a>, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called <strong>resi[.]to</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73004\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-73004\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-93-95-112-53.png\" width=\"749\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73004\">On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet.</p></div>\n<p>When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including &#8220;<strong>Shox</strong>&#8221; &#8212; the nickname used by Resi Rack&#8217;s co-founder Mr. Hales &#8212; and his business partner &#8220;<strong>Linus</strong>,&#8221; who did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<p>Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-hackerpakistan.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post new IP addresses</a> that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025.</p>\n<p>Neither of Resi Rack&#8217;s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for nearly two years. According to a review of Discord messages indexed by the cyber intelligence firm <strong>Flashpoint</strong>, Shox and Linus spent much of 2024 selling static &#8220;ISP proxies&#8221; by routing various Internet address blocks at major U.S. Internet service providers.</p>\n<p>In February 2025, AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://serviceguidenew.att.com/sg_CustomPreviewer?attachmentId=00PPV00001Jf2Qf2AJ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that effective July 31, 2025, it would no longer originate routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&amp;T (other major ISPs have since made similar moves). Less than a month later, Shox and Linus told customers they would soon cease offering static ISP proxies as a result of these policy changes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73006\" style=\"width: 529px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73006\" height=\"537\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shox-linus-static-att.png\" width=\"519\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73006\">Shox and Linux, talking about their decision to stop selling ISP proxies.</p></div>\n<h2>DORT &amp; SNOW</h2>\n<p>The stated owner of the resi[.]to Discord server went by the abbreviated username &#8220;D.&#8221; That initial appears to be short for the hacker handle &#8220;<strong>Dort</strong>,&#8221; a name that was invoked frequently throughout these Discord chats.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73003\" style=\"width: 617px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73003\" height=\"765\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/resito-d-profile.png\" width=\"607\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73003\">Dort&#8217;s profile on resi dot to.</p></div>\n<p>This &#8220;Dort&#8221; nickname came up in KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s recent conversations with &#8220;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/forky/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Forky</strong></a>,&#8221; a Brazilian man who <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged</a> being involved in the marketing of the Aisuru botnet at its inception in late 2024.

The other individual Forky named as an Aisuru/Kimwolf botmaster goes by the nickname &#8220;<strong>Snow</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On January 2 &#8212; just hours after our story on Kimwolf was published &#8212; the historical chat records on resi[.]to were erased without warning and replaced by <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fsckben.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a profanity-laced message</a> for Synthient&#8217;s founder. Minutes after that, the entire server disappeared.</p>\n<p>Later that same day, several of the more active members of the now-defunct resi[.]to Discord server moved to a Telegram channel where they posted Brundage&#8217;s personal information, and generally complained about being unable to find reliable &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; hosting for their botnet.</p>\n<p>Hilariously, a user by the name &#8220;Richard Remington&#8221; briefly appeared in the group&#8217;s Telegram server to post a crude &#8220;Happy New Year&#8221; sketch that claims Dort and Snow are now in control of 3.5 million devices infected by Aisuru and/or Kimwolf. Richard Remington&#8217;s Telegram account has since been deleted, but it previously stated its owner <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/remington-dstat.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">operates a website</a> that caters to DDoS-for-hire or &#8220;stresser&#8221; services seeking to test their firepower.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dort-snow-kimwolf-aisuru.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-73005\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dort-snow-kimwolf-aisuru.png\" width=\"749\" /></a><span id=\"more-72999\"></span></p>\n<h2>BYTECONNECT, PLAINPROXIES, AND 3XK TECH</h2>\n<p>Reports from both Synthient and XLab found that Kimwolf was used to deploy programs that turned infected systems into Internet traffic relays for multiple residential proxy services. Among those was a component that installed a software development kit (SDK) called <strong>ByteConnect,</strong> which is distributed by a provider known as <strong>Plainproxies</strong>.</p>\n<p>ByteConnect says it specializes in &#8220;monetizing apps ethically and free,&#8221; while Plainproxies advertises the ability to provide content scraping companies with &#8220;unlimited&#8221; proxy pools. However, Synthient said that upon connecting to ByteConnect&#8217;s SDK they instead observed a mass influx of credential-stuffing attacks targeting email servers and popular online websites.</p>\n<p>A search on LinkedIn finds the CEO of Plainproxies is <strong>Friedrich Kraft</strong>, whose <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/friedrich-kr%C3%A4ft-1478a3248/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">resume</a> says he is co-founder of ByteConnect Ltd. Public Internet routing records show Mr. Kraft also operates a hosting firm in Germany called <strong>3XK Tech GmbH</strong>. Mr. Kraft did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.</p>\n<p>In July 2025, Cloudflare reported that 3XK Tech (a.k.a. Drei-K-Tech) had become <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2025-q2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Internet&#8217;s largest source of application-layer DDoS attacks</a>. In November 2025, the security firm <strong>GreyNoise Intelligence</strong> <a href=\"https://www.greynoise.io/blog/palo-alto-scanning-surges-90-day-high\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that Internet addresses on 3XK Tech were responsible for roughly three-quarters of the Internet scanning being done at the time for a newly discovered and critical vulnerability in security products made by Palo Alto Networks.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73010\" style=\"width: 775px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73010\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cloudflare-3XKTech.png\" width=\"765\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73010\">Source: Cloudflare&#8217;s Q2 2025 DDoS threat report.</p></div>\n<p>LinkedIn has <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliadml/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a profile</a> for another Plainproxies employee, <strong>Julia Levi</strong>, who is listed as co-founder of ByteConnect. Ms. Levi did not respond to requests for comment. Her resume says she previously worked for two major proxy providers: Netnut Proxy Network, and Bright Data.</p>\n<p>Synthient likewise said Plainproxies ignored their outreach, noting that the Byteconnect SDK continues to remain active on devices compromised by Kimwolf.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73053\" style=\"width: 717px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73053\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/julialevi-plainproxies.png\" width=\"707\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73053\">A post from the LinkedIn page of Plainproxies Chief Revenue Officer Julia Levi, explaining how the residential proxy business works.</p></div>\n<h2>MASKIFY</h2>\n<p>Synthient&#8217;s <a href=\"https://synthient.com/blog/a-broken-system-fueling-botnets\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">January 2 report</a> said another proxy provider heavily involved in the sale of Kimwolf proxies was <strong>Maskify</strong>, which currently advertises on multiple cybercrime forums that it has more than six million residential Internet addresses for rent.</p>\n<p>Maskify prices its service at a rate of 30 cents per gigabyte of data relayed through their proxies. According to Synthient, that price range is insanely low and is far cheaper than any other proxy provider in business today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Synthient’s Research Team received screenshots from other proxy providers showing key Kimwolf actors attempting to offload proxy bandwidth in exchange for upfront cash,&#8221; the Synthient report noted. &#8220;This approach likely helped fuel early development, with associated members spending earnings on infrastructure and outsourced development tasks. Please note that resellers know precisely what they are selling; proxies at these prices are not ethically sourced.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maskify did not respond to requests for comment.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73018\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73018\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/synthient-maskify.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73018\">The Maskify website.

As documented by XLab, in mid-December the Kimwolf operators upgraded their infrastructure and began using ENS to better withstand the near-constant takedown efforts targeting the botnet&#8217;s control servers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73007\" style=\"width: 727px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-73007\" height=\"358\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pawsat-eth.png\" width=\"717\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73007\">An ENS record used by the Kimwolf operators taunts security firms trying to take down the botnet&#8217;s control servers. Image: XLab.</p></div>\n<p>By telling infected systems to seek out the Kimwolf control servers via ENS, even if the servers that the botmasters use to control the botnet are taken down the attacker only needs to update the ENS text record to reflect the new Internet address of the control server, and the infected devices will immediately know where to look for further instructions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This channel itself relies on the decentralized nature of blockchain, unregulated by Ethereum or other blockchain operators, and cannot be blocked,&#8221; XLab wrote.</p>\n<p>The text records included in Kimwolf&#8217;s ENS instructions can also feature short messages, such as those that carried Brundage&#8217;s personal information. Other ENS text records associated with Kimwolf offered some sage advice: &#8220;If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_73041\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-73041\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ens-destroytvbox.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-73041\">An ENS record tied to the Kimwolf botnet advises, &#8220;If flagged, we encourage the TV box to be destroyed.&#8221;</p></div>\n<p>Both Synthient and XLabs say Kimwolf targets a vast number of Android TV streaming box models, all of which have zero security protections, and many of which ship with proxy malware built in. Generally speaking, if you can send a data packet to one of these devices you can also seize administrative control over it.</p>\n<p>If you own a TV box that matches <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of these model names and/or numbers</a>, please just rip it out of your network.

Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in.</p></div>\n<p>The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed <strong>Kimwolf</strong>, which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic &#8212; such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping &#8212; and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time.</p>\n<p>More important than Kimwolf&#8217;s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various &#8220;<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">residential proxy</a>&#8221; networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user&#8217;s firewall and Internet router.</p>\n<p>Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe.</p>\n<p>The malware that turns an end-user&#8217;s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via <strong>unofficial Android TV boxes</strong> sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>BestBuy, Newegg</strong>, and <strong>Walmart</strong>.</p>\n<p>These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers</a>, and <em>frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free</em>. But there&#8217;s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we&#8217;ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72949\" style=\"width: 756px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-72949\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/u-androidtv-kimwolf.png\" width=\"746\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72949\">Some of the unsanctioned Android TV boxes that come with residential proxy malware pre-installed. Image: Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from <strong>Quokka</strong> published <a href=\"https://go.quokka.io/hubfs/App-Intel/Technical_Uhale-Digital-Picture-Frame-Security-Assessment.pdf?is=1ef7934f6635b02395adcab09a0c1b24bf0ea745b648bfe87189de8aadc7300b\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the <strong>Uhale app &#8212; </strong>including Amazon&#8217;s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025.</p>\n<p>There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others.</p>\n<p>The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network.</p>\n<h2>THERE&#8217;S NO PLACE LIKE 127.0.0.1</h2>\n<p>The combination of these two security realities came to the fore in October 2025, when an undergraduate computer science student at the <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong> began closely tracking Kimwolf&#8217;s growth, and interacting directly with its apparent creators on a daily basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Benjamin Brundage </strong>is the 22-year-old founder of the security firm <strong>Synthient</strong>, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks and learn how those networks are being abused. Conducting much of his research into Kimwolf while studying for final exams, Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in late October 2025 he suspected Kimwolf was a new Android-based variant of <strong>Aisuru</strong>, a botnet that was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">incorrectly blamed</a> for a number of record-smashing DDoS attacks last fall.</p>\n<p>Brundage says Kimwolf grew rapidly by abusing a glaring vulnerability in many of the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy services. The crux of the weakness, he explained, was that these proxy services weren&#8217;t doing enough to prevent their customers from forwarding requests to internal servers of the individual proxy endpoints.</p>\n<p>Most proxy services take basic steps to prevent their paying customers from &#8220;going upstream&#8221; into the local network of proxy endpoints, by explicitly denying requests for local addresses specified in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RFC-1918</a>, including the well-known <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/network-address-translation-nat/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Network Address Translation</a> (NAT) ranges 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, and 172.16.0.0/12. These ranges allow multiple devices in a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address, and if you run any kind of home or office network, your internal address space operates within one or more of these NAT ranges.</p>\n<p>However, Brundage discovered that the people operating Kimwolf had figured out how to talk directly to devices on the internal networks of millions of residential proxy endpoints, simply by changing their <strong>Domain Name System</strong> (DNS) settings to match those in the RFC-1918 address ranges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is possible to circumvent existing domain restrictions by using DNS records that point to 192.168.0.1 or 0.0.0.0,&#8221; Brundage wrote in a first-of-its-kind security advisory sent to nearly a dozen residential proxy providers in mid-December 2025. &#8220;This grants an attacker the ability to send carefully crafted requests to the current device or a device on the local network. This is actively being exploited, with attackers leveraging this functionality to drop malware.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As with the digital photo frames mentioned above, many of these residential proxy services run solely on mobile devices that are running some game, VPN or other app with a hidden component that turns the user&#8217;s mobile phone into a residential proxy &#8212; often without any meaningful consent.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://synthient.com/blog/a-broken-system-fueling-botnets\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a report published today</a>, Synthient said key actors involved in Kimwolf were observed monetizing the botnet through app installs, selling residential proxy bandwidth, and selling its DDoS functionality.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Synthient expects to observe a growing interest among threat actors in gaining unrestricted access to proxy networks to infect devices, obtain network access, or access sensitive information,&#8221; the report observed. &#8220;Kimwolf highlights the risks posed by unsecured proxy networks and their viability as an attack vector.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>ANDROID DEBUG BRIDGE</h2>\n<p>After purchasing a number of unofficial Android TV box models that were most heavily represented in the Kimwolf botnet, Brundage further discovered the proxy service vulnerability was only part of the reason for Kimwolf&#8217;s rapid rise: He also found virtually all of the devices he tested were shipped from the factory with a powerful feature called <strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong> (ADB) mode enabled by default.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72951\" style=\"width: 661px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72951\" height=\"611\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/china-overseasuseonly.png\" width=\"651\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72951\">Many of the unofficial Android TV boxes infected by Kimwolf include the ominous disclaimer: &#8220;Made in China. Overseas use only.&#8221; Image: Synthient.</p></div>\n<p>ADB is a diagnostic tool intended for use solely during the manufacturing and testing processes, because it allows the devices to be remotely configured and even updated with new (and potentially malicious) firmware. However, shipping these devices with ADB turned on creates a security nightmare because in this state they constantly listen for and accept unauthenticated connection requests.</p>\n<p>For example, opening a command prompt and typing &#8220;adb connect&#8221; along with a vulnerable device&#8217;s (local) IP address followed immediately by &#8220;:5555&#8221; will very quickly offer unrestricted &#8220;super user&#8221; administrative access.</p>\n<p>Brundage said by early December, he&#8217;d identified a one-to-one overlap between new Kimwolf infections and proxy IP addresses offered for rent by China-based <strong>IPIDEA</strong>, currently the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy network by all accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kimwolf has almost doubled in size this past week, just by exploiting IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy pool,&#8221; Brundage told KrebsOnSecurity in early December as he was preparing to notify IPIDEA and 10 other proxy providers about his research.</p>\n<p>Brundage said Synthient first confirmed on December 1, 2025 that the Kimwolf botnet operators were tunneling back through IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy network and into the local networks of systems running IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy software. The attackers dropped the malware payload by directing infected systems to visit a specific Internet address and to call out the pass phrase &#8220;<strong>krebsfiveheadindustries</strong>&#8221; in order to unlock the malicious download.</p>\n<p>On December 30, Synthient said it was tracking roughly 2 million IPIDEA addresses exploited by Kimwolf in the previous week. Brundage said he has witnessed Kimwolf rebuilding itself after one recent takedown effort targeting its control servers &#8212; from almost nothing to two million infected systems just by tunneling through proxy endpoints on IPIDEA for a couple of days.</p>\n<p>Brundage said IPIDEA has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of new proxies, <em>advertising access to more than 100 million residential proxy endpoints around the globe in the past week alone</em>. Analyzing the exposed devices that were part of IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy pool, Synthient said it found <em>more than two-thirds were Android devices that could be compromised with no authentication needed</em>.</p>\n<h2>SECURITY NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE</h2>\n<p>After charting a tight overlap in Kimwolf-infected IP addresses and those sold by IPIDEA, Brundage was eager to make his findings public: The vulnerability had clearly been exploited for several months, although it appeared that only a handful of cybercrime actors were aware of the capability. But he also knew that going public without giving vulnerable proxy providers an opportunity to understand and patch it would only lead to more mass abuse of these services by additional cybercriminal groups.</p>\n<p>On December 17, Brundage sent a security notification to all 11 of the apparently affected proxy providers, hoping to give each at least a few weeks to acknowledge and address the core problems identified in his report before he went public. Many proxy providers who received the notification were resellers of IPIDEA that white-labeled the company&#8217;s service.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity first sought comment from IPIDEA in October 2025, in reporting on a story about how the proxy network appeared to have benefitted from the rise of the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aisuru botnet</a>, whose administrators appeared to shift from using the botnet primarily for DDoS attacks to simply installing IPIDEA&#8217;s proxy program, among others.</p>\n<p>On December 25, KrebsOnSecurity received an email from an IPIDEA employee identified only as &#8220;<strong>Oliver</strong>,&#8221; who said allegations that IPIDEA had benefitted from Aisuru&#8217;s rise were baseless.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After comprehensively verifying IP traceability records and supplier cooperation agreements, we found no association between any of our IP resources and the Aisuru botnet, nor have we received any notifications from authoritative institutions regarding our IPs being involved in malicious activities,&#8221; Oliver wrote. &#8220;In addition, for external cooperation, we implement a three-level review mechanism for suppliers, covering qualification verification, resource legality authentication and continuous dynamic monitoring, to ensure no compliance risks throughout the entire cooperation process.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;IPIDEA firmly opposes all forms of unfair competition and malicious smearing in the industry, always participates in market competition with compliant operation and honest cooperation, and also calls on the entire industry to jointly abandon irregular and unethical behaviors and build a clean and fair market ecosystem,&#8221; Oliver continued.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the same day that Oliver&#8217;s email arrived, Brundage shared a response he&#8217;d just received from IPIDEA&#8217;s security officer, who identified himself only by the first name <strong>Byron</strong>. The security officer said IPIDEA had made a number of important security changes to its residential proxy service to address the vulnerability identified in Brundage&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By design, the proxy service does not allow access to any internal or local address space,&#8221; Byron explained. &#8220;This issue was traced to a legacy module used solely for testing and debugging purposes, which did not fully inherit the internal network access restrictions. Under specific conditions, this module could be abused to reach internal resources. The affected paths have now been fully blocked and the module has been taken offline.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Byron told Brundage IPIDEA also instituted multiple mitigations for blocking DNS resolution to internal (NAT) IP ranges, and that it was now blocking proxy endpoints from forwarding traffic on &#8220;high-risk&#8221; ports &#8220;to prevent abuse of the service for scanning, lateral movement, or access to internal services.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72905\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-72905\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ipidea-byron.png\" width=\"749\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72905\">An excerpt from an email sent by IPIDEA&#8217;s security officer in response to Brundage&#8217;s vulnerability notification.

The researchers noted that “the infection of a node enables the 911S5 user to access shared resources on the network such as local intranet portals or other services.”</p>\n<p>“It also enables the end user to probe the LAN network of the infected node,” the researchers <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220715000000*/https://gric.recherche.usherbrooke.ca/rpaas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a>. “Using the internal router, it would be possible to poison the DNS cache of the LAN router of the infected node, enabling further attacks.”</p>\n<p>911S5 initially responded to our reporting in 2022 by claiming it was conducting a top-down security review of the service. But the proxy service abruptly closed up shop just one week later, saying a malicious hacker had destroyed all of the company&#8217;s customer and payment records. In July 2024, The <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong> <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned the alleged creators of 911S5</a>, and the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> arrested the Chinese national named in my 2022 profile of the proxy service.</p>\n<p>Kilmer said IPIDEA also operates a sister service called <strong>922 Proxy</strong>, which the company has pitched from Day One as a seamless alternative to 911S5 Proxy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You cannot tell me they don&#8217;t want the 911 customers by calling it that,&#8221; Kilmer said.</p>\n<p>Among the recipients of Synthient&#8217;s notification was the proxy giant <strong>Oxylabs</strong>. Brundage shared an email he received from Oxylabs&#8217; security team on December 31, which acknowledged Oxylabs had started rolling out security modifications to address the vulnerabilities described in Synthient&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Reached for comment, Oxylabs confirmed they &#8220;have implemented changes that now eliminate the ability to bypass the blocklist and forward requests to private network addresses using a controlled domain.&#8221; But it said there is no evidence that Kimwolf or other other attackers exploited its network.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In parallel, we reviewed the domains identified in the reported exploitation activity and did not observe traffic associated with them,&#8221; the Oxylabs statement continued. &#8220;Based on this review, there is no indication that our residential network was impacted by these activities.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS</h2>\n<p>Consider the following scenario, in which the mere act of allowing someone to use your Wi-Fi network could lead to a Kimwolf botnet infection. In this example, a friend or family member comes to stay with you for a few days, and you grant them access to your Wi-Fi without knowing that their mobile phone is infected with an app that turns the device into a residential proxy node. At that point, your home&#8217;s public IP address will show up for rent at the website of some residential proxy provider.</p>\n<p>Miscreants like those behind Kimwolf then use residential proxy services online to access that proxy node on your IP, tunnel back through it and into your local area network (LAN), and automatically scan the internal network for devices with Android Debug Bridge mode turned on.</p>\n<p>By the time your guest has packed up their things, said their goodbyes and disconnected from your Wi-Fi, you now have two devices on your local network &#8212; a digital photo frame and an unsanctioned Android TV box &#8212; that are infected with Kimwolf. You may have never intended for these devices to be exposed to the larger Internet, and yet there you are.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s another possible nightmare scenario: Attackers use their access to proxy networks to modify your Internet router&#8217;s settings so that it relies on malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers &#8212; allowing them to control where your Web browser goes when it requests a website. Think that&#8217;s far-fetched? Recall the <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/dnschanger-trojan/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DNSChanger malware from 2012</a> that infected more than a half-million routers with search-hijacking malware, and ultimately spawned an entire security industry working group focused on containing and eradicating it.</p>\n<h2>XLAB</h2>\n<p>Much of what is published so far on Kimwolf has come from the Chinese security firm <strong>XLab</strong>, which was the first to <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chronicle the rise of the Aisuru botnet</a> in late 2024. In <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">its latest blog post</a>, XLab said it began tracking Kimwolf on October 24, when the botnet&#8217;s control servers were swamping Cloudflare&#8217;s DNS servers with lookups for the distinctive domain 14emeliaterracewestroxburyma02132[.]su.</p>\n<p>This domain and others connected to early Kimwolf variants spent several weeks <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">topping Cloudflare&#8217;s chart of the Internet&#8217;s most sought-after domains</a>, edging out Google.com and Apple.com of their rightful spots in the top 5 most-requested domains. That&#8217;s because during that time Kimwolf was asking its millions of bots to check in frequently using Cloudflare&#8217;s DNS servers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72954\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-72954\" height=\"798\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlab-countrykimwolf.png\" width=\"747\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72954\">The Chinese security firm XLab found the Kimwolf botnet had enslaved between 1.8 and 2 million devices, with heavy concentrations in Brazil, India, The United States of America and Argentina. Image: blog.xLab.qianxin.com</p></div>\n<p>It is clear from reading the XLab report that KrebsOnSecurity (and security experts) probably erred in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/cloudflare-scrubs-aisuru-botnet-from-top-domains-list/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">misattributing some of Kimwolf&#8217;s early activities</a> to the Aisuru botnet, which appears to be operated by a different group entirely. IPDEA may have been truthful when it said it had no affiliation with the Aisuru botnet, but Brundage&#8217;s data left no doubt that its proxy service clearly was being massively abused by Aisuru&#8217;s Android variant, Kimwolf.</p>\n<p>XLab said Kimwolf has infected at least 1.8 million devices, and has shown it is able to rebuild itself quickly from scratch.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Analysis indicates that Kimwolf&#8217;s primary infection targets are TV boxes deployed in residential network environments,&#8221; XLab researchers wrote. &#8220;Since residential networks usually adopt dynamic IP allocation mechanisms, the public IPs of devices change over time, so the true scale of infected devices cannot be accurately measured solely by the quantity of IPs. In other words, the cumulative observation of 2.7 million IP addresses does not equate to 2.7 million infected devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>XLab said measuring Kimwolf&#8217;s size also is difficult because infected devices are distributed across multiple global time zones. &#8220;Affected by time zone differences and usage habits (e.g., turning off devices at night, not using TV boxes during holidays, etc.), these devices are not online simultaneously, further increasing the difficulty of comprehensive observation through a single time window,&#8221; the blog post observed.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation&#8221; on Yours Truly, apparently leaving &#8220;easter eggs&#8221; related to my name in multiple places through the botnet&#8217;s code and communications:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72955\" style=\"width: 745px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-72955\" height=\"702\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlab-kimwolfk.png\" width=\"735\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72955\">Image: XLAB.</p></div>\n<h2>ANALYSIS AND ADVICE</h2>\n<p>One frustrating aspect of threats like Kimwolf is that in most cases it is not easy for the average user to determine if there are any devices on their internal network which may be vulnerable to threats like Kimwolf and/or already infected with residential proxy malware.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s assume that through years of security training or some dark magic you can successfully identify that residential proxy activity on your internal network was linked to a specific mobile device inside your house: From there, you&#8217;d still need to isolate and remove the app or unwanted component that is turning the device into a residential proxy.</p>\n<p>Also, the tooling and knowledge needed to achieve this kind of visibility just isn&#8217;t there from an average consumer standpoint. The work that it takes to configure your network so you can see and interpret logs of all traffic coming in and out is largely beyond the skillset of most Internet users (and, I&#8217;d wager, many security experts). But it&#8217;s a topic worth exploring in an upcoming story.</p>\n<p>Happily, Synthient has erected <a href=\"https://synthient.com/check\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a page on its website</a> that will state whether a visitor&#8217;s public Internet address was seen among those of Kimwolf-infected systems. Brundage also has compiled <a href=\"https://github.com/synthient/public-research/blob/main/2026/01/kimwolf/product_devices.csv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a list of the unofficial Android TV boxes</a> that are most highly represented in the Kimwolf botnet.</p>\n<p>If you own a TV box that matches one of these model names and/or numbers, please just rip it out of your network. If you encounter one of these devices on the network of a family member or friend, send them a link to this story and explain that it&#8217;s not worth the potential hassle and harm created by keeping them plugged in.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72953\" style=\"width: 760px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-72953\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synthient-topproductdevices.png\" width=\"750\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72953\">The top 15 product devices represented in the Kimwolf botnet, according to Synthient.</p></div>\n<p><strong>Chad Seaman</strong> is a principal security researcher with <strong>Akamai Technologies</strong>. Seaman said he wants more consumers to be wary of these pseudo Android TV boxes to the point where they avoid them altogether.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want the consumer to be paranoid of these crappy devices and of these residential proxy schemes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to highlight why they&#8217;re dangerous to everyone and to the individual. The whole security model where people think their LAN (Local Internal Network) is safe, that there aren&#8217;t any bad guys on the LAN so it can&#8217;t be that dangerous is just really outdated now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that an app can enable this type of abuse on my network and other networks, that should really give you pause,&#8221; about which devices to allow onto your local network, Seaman said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not just Android devices here. Some of these proxy services have SDKs for Mac and Windows, and the iPhone. It could be running something that inadvertently cracks open your network and lets countless random people inside.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In July 2025, Google filed a “John Doe” <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466/gov.uscourts.nysd.643466.22.0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lawsuit</a> (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants collectively dubbed the “<strong>BadBox 2.0 Enterprise</strong>,” which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Google’s lawsuit came on the heels of a <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June 2025 advisory</a> from the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user’s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors &#8212; usually during the set-up process.</p>\n<p>The FBI said BADBOX 2.0 was discovered after the original BADBOX campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original BADBOX was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase.</p>\n<p><strong>Lindsay Kaye</strong> is vice president of threat intelligence at <strong>HUMAN Security</strong>, a company that worked closely on the BADBOX investigations. Kaye said the BADBOX botnets and the residential proxy networks that rode on top of compromised devices were detected because they enabled a ridiculous amount of advertising fraud, as well as ticket scalping, retail fraud, account takeovers and content scraping.</p>\n<p>Kaye said consumers should stick to known brands when it comes to purchasing things that require a wired or wireless connection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people are asking what they can do to avoid being victimized by proxies, it&#8217;s safest to stick with name brands,&#8221; Kaye said. &#8220;Anything promising something for free or low-cost, or giving you something for nothing just isn&#8217;t worth it. And be careful about what apps you allow on your phone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many wireless routers these days make it relatively easy to deploy a &#8220;Guest&#8221; wireless network on-the-fly. Doing so allows your guests to browse the Internet just fine but it blocks their device from being able to talk to other devices on the local network &#8212; such as shared folders, printers and drives. If someone &#8212; a friend, family member, or contractor &#8212; requests access to your network, give them the guest Wi-Fi network credentials if you have that option.</p>\n<p>There is a small but vocal pro-piracy camp that is almost condescendingly dismissive of the security threats posed by these unsanctioned Android TV boxes. These tech purists positively chafe at the idea of people wholesale discarding one of these TV boxes. A common refrain from this camp is that Internet-connected devices are not inherently bad or good, and that even factory-infected boxes can be flashed with new firmware or custom ROMs that contain no known dodgy software.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to point out that the majority of people buying these devices are not security or hardware experts; the devices are sought out because they dangle something of value for &#8220;free.&#8221; Most buyers have no idea of the bargain they&#8217;re making when plugging one of these dodgy TV boxes into their network.</p>\n<p>It is somewhat remarkable that we haven&#8217;t yet seen the entertainment industry applying more visible pressure on the major e-commerce vendors to stop peddling this insecure and actively malicious hardware that is largely made and marketed for video piracy. These TV boxes are a public nuisance for bundling malicious software while having no apparent security or authentication built-in, and these two qualities make them an attractive nuisance for cybercriminals.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for Part II in this series, which will poke through clues left behind by the people who appear to have built Kimwolf and benefited from it the most.</p>"

A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/bulletproof-host-stark-industries-evades-eu-sanctions/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rebranding and transferring considerable network assets</a> to other entities they control.</p>\n<p>In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-cryptocurrency-turns-to-cash-in-russian-banks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">profiled Cryptomus,</a> a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers.

In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">they had reached the same conclusion</a>.</p>\n<p>Phishing was a major theme of this year&#8217;s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">voice phishing gangs</a> that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-prolific-voice-phishing-crew/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew</a> examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.</p>\n<p>Nearly a half-dozen stories in 2025 dissected the incessant <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sms+phish+china\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SMS phishing or &#8220;smishing&#8221; coming from China-based phishing kit vendors</a>, who make it easy for customers to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">convert phished payment card data into mobile wallets</a> from Apple and Google.

The arrests came shortly after the FBI and the Dutch police <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/fbi-dutch-police-disrupt-manipulaters-phishing-gang/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seized dozens of servers and domains for the group</a>. Many of those arrested were first publicly identified in a 2021 story here about how they&#8217;d inadvertently infected their computers with malware <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/pakistan-arrests-21-in-heartsender-malware-service/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">that gave away their real-life identities</a>.</p>\n<p>In April, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the proprietors of a Pakistan-based e-commerce company for conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States. The following month, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how the proprietors of the sanctioned entity are perhaps better known for operating an elaborate and lengthy scheme to<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/pakistani-firm-shipped-fentanyl-analogs-scams-to-us/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs</a>.<span id=\"more-72907\"></span></p>\n<p>Earlier this month, we examined an academic cheating empire turbocharged by Google Ads that earned tens of millions of dollars in revenue and has <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/drones-to-diplomas-how-russias-largest-private-university-is-linked-to-a-25m-essay-mill/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">curious ties to a Kremlin-connected oligarch whose Russian university builds drones for Russia&#8217;s war against Ukraine</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72797\" style=\"width: 750px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\" wp-image-72797\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/synergy-bot.png\" width=\"740\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72797\">An attack drone advertised on a website hosted in the same network as Russia&#8217;s largest private education company &#8212; Synergy University.</p></div>\n<p>As ever, KrebsOnSecurity endeavored to keep close tabs on the world&#8217;s biggest and most disruptive botnets, which pummeled the Internet this year with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults that were <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two to three times the size and impact of previous record DDoS attacks</a>.</p>\n<p>In June, KrebsOnSecurity.com was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hit by the largest DDoS attack</a> that Google had ever mitigated at the time (we are a grateful guest of Google&#8217;s excellent <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=project+shield\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Project Shield</a> offering). Experts blamed that attack on an Internet-of-Things botnet called <strong>Aisuru</strong> that had rapidly grown in size and firepower since its debut in late 2024. Another Aisuru attack on Cloudflare just days later practically doubled the size of the June attack against this website. Not long after that, Aisuru was blamed for a DDoS that again doubled the previous record.</p>\n<p>In October, it appeared the cybercriminals in control of Aisuru had shifted the botnet&#8217;s focus from DDoS to a more sustainable and profitable use: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic</a>.</p>\n<p>However, it has recently become clear that at least some of the disruptive botnet and residential proxy activity attributed to Aisuru last year likely was the work of people responsible for building and testing a powerful botnet known as <strong>Kimwolf</strong>. Chinese security firm <strong>XLab, </strong>which was the first to chronicle Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024, <a href=\"https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/kimwolf-botnet-en/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently profiled Kimwolf</a> as easily the world&#8217;s biggest and most dangerous collection of compromised machines &#8212; with approximately 1.83 million devices under its thumb as of December 17.</p>\n<p>XLab noted that the Kimwolf author &#8220;shows an almost &#8216;obsessive&#8217; fixation on the well-known cybersecurity investigative journalist Brian Krebs, leaving easter eggs related to him in multiple places.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72917\" style=\"width: 759px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-72917\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/xlabs-littlegossip.png\" width=\"749\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72917\">Image: XLab, Kimwolf Botnet Exposed: The Massive Android Botnet with 1.8 million infected devices.</p></div>\n<p>I am happy to report that the first KrebsOnSecurity stories of 2026 will go deep into the origins of Kimwolf, and examine the botnet&#8217;s unique and highly invasive means of spreading digital disease far and wide. The first in that series will include a somewhat sobering and global security notification concerning the devices and residential proxy services that are inadvertently helping to power Kimwolf&#8217;s rapid growth.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for your continued readership, encouragement and support.

These shifts, along with the president&#8217;s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren&#8217;t even aware of them all.</p>\n<h2>FREE SPEECH</h2>\n<p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed that a primary reason he lost the 2020 election was that social media and Big Tech companies had conspired to silence conservative voices and stifle free speech. Naturally, the president&#8217;s impulse in his second term has been to use the levers of the federal government in an effort to limit the speech of everyday Americans, as well as foreigners wishing to visit the United States.</p>\n<p>In September, Donald Trump signed a national security directive known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSPM-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NSPM-7</a>, which directs federal law enforcement officers and intelligence analysts to target &#8220;anti-American&#8221; activity, including any &#8220;tax crimes&#8221; involving extremist groups who defrauded the IRS. According to <a href=\"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/leak-fbi-list-of-extremists-is-coming?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extensive reporting</a> by journalist <strong>Ken Klippenstein</strong>, the focus of the order is on those expressing &#8220;opposition to law and immigration enforcement; extreme views in favor of mass migration and open borders; adherence to radical gender ideology,&#8221; as well as &#8220;anti-Americanism,&#8221; &#8220;anti-capitalism,&#8221; and &#8220;anti-Christianity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, <strong>Attorney General Pam Bondi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3915104/bondi-orders-fbi-launch-cash-reward-system-reporting-alleged-domestic-terrorists/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued a memo</a> advising the FBI to compile a list of Americans whose activities &#8220;may constitute domestic terrorism.&#8221; Bondi also ordered the FBI to establish a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-12-11/justice-department-drafting-list-of-domestic-terrorists\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash reward system</a>&#8221; to encourage the public to report suspected domestic terrorist activity. The memo states that domestic terrorism could include &#8220;opposition to law and immigration enforcement&#8221; or support for &#8220;radical gender ideology.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Trump administration also is planning to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/us-to-inspect-tourists-social-media-history-from-past-5-years-.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">impose social media restrictions</a> on tourists as the president continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors. According to <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/10/2025-22461/agency-information-collection-activities-revision-arrival-and-departure-record-form-i-94-and\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a notice</a> from <strong>U.S. Customs and Border Protection</strong> (CBP), tourists &#8212; including those from Britain, Australia, France, and Japan &#8212; will soon be required to provide five years of their social media history.</p>\n<p>The CBP said it will also collect &#8220;several high value data fields,&#8221; including applicants&#8217; email addresses from the past 10 years, their telephone numbers used in the past five years, and names and details of family members. Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-searched-a-record-number-of-phones-at-the-us-border-over-the-past-year/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in October that the US CBP executed more device searches at the border in the first three months of the year than any other previous quarter.</p>\n<p>The new requirements from CBP add meat to the bones of <strong>Executive Order 14161</strong>, which in the name of combating &#8220;foreign terrorist and public safety threats&#8221; granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics alleged the order&#8217;s vague language around &#8220;public safety threats,&#8221; creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion. At least 35 nations are now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/us/politics/trump-expanded-travel-ban.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">under some form of U.S. travel restrictions</a>.</p>\n<h2>CRIME AND CORRUPTION</h2>\n<p>In February, Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ordered</a> executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the <strong>U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</strong>, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for “remedial actions” of past enforcement actions deemed “inappropriate.”</p>\n<p>The White House also disbanded the <strong>Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative</strong> and <strong>KleptoCapture Task Force</strong> — units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs — and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.</p>\n<p>Also in February, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/doj-disbands-foreign-influence-task-force/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dissolved</a> the FBI&#8217;s <strong>Foreign Influence Task Force</strong>, an entity created during Trump&#8217;s first term designed to counter the influence of foreign governments on American politics.</p>\n<p>In March 2025, Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-suspends-some-efforts-counter-russian-sabotage-trump-moves-closer-putin-2025-03-19/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that several U.S. national security agencies had halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks. Former President Joe Biden had ordered his national security team to establish working groups to monitor the issue amid warnings from U.S. intelligence that Russia was escalating a shadow war against Western nations.</p>\n<p>In a test of prosecutorial independence, Trump&#8217;s Justice Department ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor <strong>Eric Adams</strong>. The fallout was immediate: Multiple senior officials resigned in protest, the case was reassigned, and chaos engulfed the Southern District of New York (SDNY) &#8211; historically one of the nation&#8217;s most aggressive offices for pursuing public corruption, white-collar crime, and cybercrime cases.</p>\n<p>When it comes to cryptocurrency, the administration has shifted regulators at the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> (SEC) away from enforcement to cheerleading an industry that has consistently been plagued by scams, fraud and rug-pulls. The SEC in 2025 systematically retreated from enforcement against cryptocurrency operators, dropping major cases against <strong>Coinbase</strong>, <strong>Binance</strong>, and others.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most troubling example involves <strong>Justin Sun</strong>, the Chinese-born founder of crypto currency company <strong>Tron</strong>. In 2023, the SEC charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. Sun subsequently invested $75 million in the Trump family&#8217;s <strong>World Liberty Financial</strong> (WLF) tokens, became the top holder of the $TRUMP memecoin, and secured a seat at an exclusive dinner with the president.</p>\n<p>In late February 2025, the SEC dropped its lawsuit. Sun promptly took Tron public through a reverse merger arranged by Dominari Securities, a firm with Trump family ties. Democratic lawmakers have urged the SEC to investigate what they call &#8220;concerning ties to President Trump and his family&#8221; as potential conflicts of interest and foreign influence.</p>\n<p>In October, President Trump pardoned <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong>, the founder of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange <strong>Binance</strong>. In 2023, Zhao and his company pled guilty to failing to prevent money laundering on the platform. Binance paid a $4 billion fine, and Zhao served a four-month sentence. As <strong>CBS News</strong> observed last month, shortly after Zhao&#8217;s pardon application, he was at the center of a blockbuster deal that put the Trump&#8217;s family&#8217;s WLF on the map.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Zhao is a citizen of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf and in May, an Emirati fund put $2 billion in Zhao&#8217;s Binance,&#8221; 60 Minutes <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pardon-of-crypto-billionaire-sparks-concerns-over-use-of-pardon-power-60-minutes-transcript/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>. &#8220;Of all the currencies in the world, the deal was done in World Liberty crypto.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>SEC Chairman</strong> <strong>Paul Atkins</strong> has made the agency&#8217;s new posture towards crypto explicit, stating &#8220;most crypto tokens are not securities.&#8221; At the same time, President Trump has directed the <strong>Department of Labor</strong> and the SEC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62w8ewg849o\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to expand 401(k) access to private equity and crypto</a> &#8212; assets that regulators have historically restricted for retail investors due to high risk, fees, opacity, and illiquidity. The executive order explicitly prioritizes &#8220;curbing ERISA litigation,&#8221; and reducing accountability for fiduciaries while shifting risk onto ordinary workers&#8217; retirement savings.</p>\n<p>At the White House&#8217;s behest, the U.S. Treasury in March <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0038\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suspended</a> the <strong>Corporate Transparency Act</strong>, a law that required companies to reveal their real owners. Finance experts warned the suspension would bring back shell companies and &#8220;<a href=\"https://thefactcoalition.org/treasury-reopens-the-floodgates-to-dirty-money-cta/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">open the flood gates of dirty money</a>&#8221; through the US, such as funds from drug gangs, human traffickers, and fraud groups.</p>\n<p>Trump&#8217;s clemency decisions have created a pattern of freed criminals committing new offenses, including <strong>Jonathan Braun</strong>, whose sentence for drug trafficking was commuted during Trump&#8217;s first term, was found guilty in 2025 of violating supervised release and faces new charges.</p>\n<p><strong>Eliyahu Weinstein</strong>, who received a commutation in January 2021 for running a Ponzi scheme, was sentenced in November 2025 to 37 years for running a new Ponzi scheme. The administration has also granted clemency to a growing list of white-collar criminals: <strong>David Gentile</strong>, a private equity executive sentenced to seven years for securities and wire fraud (functionally a ponzi-like scheme), and <strong>Trevor Milton</strong>, the Nikola founder sentenced to four years for defrauding investors over electric vehicle technology. The message: Financial crimes against ordinary investors are no big deal.</p>\n<p>At least 10 of the January 6 insurrectionists pardoned by President Trump <a href=\"https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/at-least-10-pardoned-insurrectionists-face-other-criminal-charges/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have already been rearrested, charged or sentenced for other crimes</a>, including plotting the murder of FBI agents, child sexual assault, possession of child sexual abuse material and reckless homicide while driving drunk.</p>\n<p>The administration also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-threatens-new-icc-sanctions-unless-court-pledges-not-prosecute-trump-2025-12-10/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">imposed sanctions</a> against the <strong>International Criminal Court</strong> (ICC). On February 6, 2025, Executive Order 14203 authorized asset freezes and visa restrictions against ICC officials investigating U.S. citizens or allies, primarily in response to the ICC&#8217;s arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month the president launched the &#8220;<strong>Gold Card</strong>,&#8221; a visa scheme established by an executive order in September that offers wealthy individuals and corporations expedited paths to U.S. residency and citizenship <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in exchange for $1 million for individuals and $2 million for companies</a>, plus ongoing fees. The administration says it is also planning to offer a &#8220;platinum&#8221; version of the card that offers special tax breaks &#8212; for a cool $5 million.<span id=\"more-72706\"></span></p>\n<h2>FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY</h2>\n<p>President Trump campaigned for a second term insisting that the previous election was riddled with fraud and had been stolen from him. Shortly after Mr. Trump took the oath of office for a second time, he fired the head of the <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) &#8212; <strong>Chris Krebs</strong> (no relation) &#8212; for having the audacity to state publicly that the 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump revoked Krebs&#8217;s security clearances, ordered a Justice Department investigation into his election security work, and suspended the security clearances of employees at <strong>SentinelOne</strong>, the cybersecurity firm where Krebs worked as chief intelligence and public policy officer. The executive order was the first direct presidential action against any US cybersecurity company. Krebs subsequently resigned from SentinelOne, telling The Wall Street Journal he was leaving to push back on Trump&#8217;s efforts &#8220;to go after corporate interests and corporate relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The president also dismissed all 15 members of the <strong>Cyber Safety Review Board </strong>(CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events &#8212; likely because those advisors included Chris Krebs.</p>\n<p>At the time, the CSRB was in the middle of compiling a much-anticipated report on the root causes of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions into at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers. Not to be outdone, the <strong>Federal Communication Commission </strong>quickly moved to <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fcc-rolls-back-cybersecurity-rules-for-telcos-despite-state-hacking-risks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">roll back a previous ruling</a> that required U.S. telecom carriers to implement stricter cybersecurity measures.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, CISA has lost roughly a third of its workforce this year amid mass layoffs and deferred resignations. When the government shutdown began in October, CISA laid off even more employees and furloughed 65 percent of the remaining staff, leaving <a href=\"https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/federal-shutdown-deal-revives-key-cisa-grant-some-staffing-a-30004\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">only 900 employees</a> working without pay.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has reassigned CISA cyber specialists to jobs supporting the president&#8217;s deportation agenda. As <strong>Bloomberg</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-08/homeland-security-cyber-personnel-reassigned-to-jobs-in-trump-s-deportation-push\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> earlier this year, CISA employees were given a week to accept the new roles or resign, and some of the reassignments included relocations to new geographic areas.</p>\n<p>The White House has signaled that it plans to <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/trump-cisa-budget-cuts-disinformation/747047/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cut an additional $491 million from CISA&#8217;s budget next year</a>, cuts that primarily target CISA programs focused on international affairs and countering misinformation and foreign propaganda. The president&#8217;s budget proposal justified the cuts by repeating debunked claims about CISA engaging in censorship.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has pursued a similar reorganization at the FBI: <strong>The Washington Post</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/08/fbi-agents-reassigned-immigration/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported in October</a> that a quarter of all FBI agents have now been reassigned from national security threats to immigration enforcement. Reuters reported last week that the replacement of seasoned leaders at the FBI and Justice Department with Trump loyalists has led to an unprecedented number of prosecutorial missteps, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/unprecedented-errors-are-eroding-credibility-trumps-justice-department-2025-12-17/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">21 percent dismissal rate</a> of the D.C. U.S. attorney&#8217;s office criminal complaints over eight weeks, compared to a mere .5% dismissal rate over the prior 10 years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These mistakes are causing department attorneys to lose credibility with federal courts, with some judges quashing subpoenas, threatening criminal contempt and issuing opinions that raise questions about their conduct,&#8221; Reuters reported. &#8220;Grand juries have also in some cases started rejecting indictments, a highly unusual event since prosecutors control what evidence gets presented.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In August, the DHS <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/state-local-cyber-grant-msisac-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">banned state and local governments from using cyber grants</a> on services provided by the <strong>Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center</strong> (MS-ISAC), a group that for more than 20 years has shared critical cybersecurity intelligence across state lines and provided software and other resources at free or heavily discounted rates. Specifically, DHS barred states from spending funds on services offered by the <strong>Elections Infrastructure ISAC</strong>, which was <a href=\"https://statescoop.com/federal-cuts-election-security-secretaries-state-2025/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">effectively shuttered</a> after DHS pulled its funding in February.</p>\n<p><strong>Cybersecurity Dive</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity-partnerships-disruption-trump-government-industry/751589/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that the Trump administration&#8217;s massive workforce cuts, along with widespread mission uncertainty and a persistent leadership void, have interrupted federal agencies&#8217; efforts to collaborate with the businesses and local utilities that run and protect healthcare facilities, water treatment plans, energy companies and telecommunications networks. The publication said the changes came after the US government eliminated <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-08/CIPAC_FAQ_2021_0.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CIPAC</a> &#8212; a framework that allowed private companies to share cyber and threat intel without legal penalties.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Government leaders have canceled meetings with infrastructure operators, forced out their longtime points of contact, stopped attending key industry events and scrapped a coordination program that made companies feel comfortable holding sensitive talks about cyberattacks and other threats with federal agencies,&#8221; Cybersecurity Dive&#8217;s <strong>Eric Geller</strong> wrote.</p>\n<p>Both the <strong>National Security Agency</strong> (NSA) and <strong>U.S. Cyber Command</strong> have been without a leader since Trump dismissed <strong>Air Force General Timothy Haugh</strong> in April, allegedly for disloyalty to the president and at the suggestion of far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. The nomination of Army Lt. Gen. William Hartman for the same position fell through in October. The White House has <a href=\"https://news.risky.biz/r/653e0b9e?m=ebb10ba8-118c-4ebb-aa1e-761703373571\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ordered the NSA to cut 8 percent of its civilian workforce</a> (between 1,500 and 2,000 employees).</p>\n<p>As <strong>The Associated Press</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/gabbard-announces-40-cut-to-workforce-at-key-u-s-intelligence-office\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> in August, the <strong>Office of the Director of National Intelligence</strong> plans to dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually. Director of National Intelligence <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong> said the cuts were warranted because ODNI had become &#8220;bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The firing or forced retirements of so many federal employees has been a boon to foreign intelligence agencies. Chinese intelligence agencies, for example, <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2025/05/16/fdd-uncovers-likely-chinese-intelligence-operation-targeting-recently-laid-off-u-s-government-employees/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> moved quickly to take advantage of the mass layoffs, using a network of front companies to recruit laid-off U.S. government employees for &#8220;consulting work.&#8221; Former workers with the Defense Department&#8217;s <strong>Defense Digital Service</strong> who resigned en-masse earlier this year thanks to DOGE encroaching on their mission <a href=\"https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/uae-recruiting-us-personnel-displaced-by-doge-to-work-on-ai-for-its-military/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">have been approached</a> by the United Arab Emirates to work on artificial intelligence for the oil kingdom&#8217;s armed forces, albeit reportedly with the blessing of the Trump administration.</p>\n<h2>PRESS FREEDOM</h2>\n<p>President Trump has filed multibillion-dollar lawsuits <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/timeline-trumps-fights-media-including-bbc-jimmy-kimmel-128441164\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">against a number of major news outlets</a> over news segments or interviews that allegedly portrayed him in a negative light, suing the networks <strong>ABC</strong>, the <strong>BBC</strong>, the <strong>CBS</strong> parent company <strong>Paramount</strong>, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong>, and <strong>The New York Times</strong>, among others.</p>\n<p>The president signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to <strong>PBS</strong> and <strong>NPR</strong>, alleging &#8220;bias&#8221; in the broadcasters&#8217; reporting. In July, Congress approved a request from Trump to cut $1.1 billion in federal funding for the <strong>Corporation for Public Broadcasting</strong>, the nonprofit entity that funds PBS and NPR.</p>\n<p><strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, the president’s pick to run the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), initially pledged to “dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.” But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, CBS and <strong>NBC</strong> over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.</p>\n<p>President Trump in February <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/trump-white-house-press-pool-access-00206001\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seized control</a> of the <strong>White House Correspondents&#8217; Association</strong>, the nonprofit entity that decides which media outlets should have access to the White House and the press pool that follows the president. The president invited an additional 32 media outlets, mostly conservative or right-wing organizations.</p>\n<p>According to the journalism group <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2025/white-house-press-pool-new-media/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Poynter.org</a>, there are three religious networks, all of which lean conservative, as well as a mix of outlets that includes a legacy paper, television networks, and a digital outlet powered by artificial intelligence.  Trump also barred <strong>The Associated Press</strong> from the White House over their refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.</p>\n<p>Under Trump appointee <strong>Kari Lake</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Agency for Global Media</strong> moved to dismantle <strong>Voice of America</strong>, <strong>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</strong>, and other networks that for decades served as credible news sources behind authoritarian lines. Courts blocked shutdown orders, but the damage continues through administrative leave, contract terminations, and funding disputes.</p>\n<p>President Trump this term has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fired most of the people</a> involved in processing <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.</p>\n<p>Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration. On March 22, the president issued <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a memorandum</a> that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to “seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,” or in matters that come before federal agencies.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration announced <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-applicants-h-1b-visa-2025-12-04/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas</a> for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in &#8220;censorship&#8221; of free speech should be considered for rejection.</p>\n<p><strong>Executive Order 14161</strong>, issued in 2025 on &#8220;foreign terrorist and public safety threats,&#8221; granted broad new authority that civil rights groups warn could enable a renewed travel ban and expanded visa denials or deportations based on perceived ideology. Critics charged that the order&#8217;s vague language around &#8220;public safety threats&#8221; creates latitude for targeting individuals based on political views, national origin, or religion.</p>\n<h2>CONSUMER PROTECTION, PRIVACY</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of this year, President Trump ordered staffers at the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong> (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation’s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws. The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans’ pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration said it planned to fire up to 90 percent of all CFPB staff, but a recent federal appeals court ruling in Washington tossed out an earlier decision that would have allowed the firings to proceed. Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-appeals-court-tosses-decision-allowing-trump-mass-firings-consumer-bureau-2025-12-17/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported this week</a> that an employee union and others have battled against it in court for ten months, during which the agency has been almost completely idled.</p>\n<p>The CFPB&#8217;s acting director is <strong>Russell Vought</strong>, a key architect of the GOP policy framework Project 2025. Under Vought&#8217;s direction, the CFPB in May <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">quietly withdrew a data broker protection rule</a> intended to limit the ability of U.S. data brokers to sell personal information on Americans.</p>\n<p>Despite the Federal Reserve&#8217;s own post-mortem <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/28/1172715215/silicon-valley-bank-postmortem-federal-reserve-fdic-signature-bank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explicitly blaming Trump-era deregulation</a> for the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, which triggered a fast-moving crisis requiring emergency weekend bailouts of banks, Trump&#8217;s banking regulators in 2025 doubled down. They loosened capital requirements, narrowed definitions of &#8220;unsafe&#8221; banking practices, and stripped specific risk categories from supervisory frameworks. The setup for another banking crisis requiring taxpayer intervention is now in place.</p>\n<p>The Privacy Act of 1974, one of the few meaningful federal privacy laws, was built on the principles of consent and separation in response to the abuses of power that came to light during the Watergate era. The law states that when an individual provides personal information to a federal agency to receive a particular service, that data must be used <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-using-americans-sensitive-data-to-build-a-digital-watchtower/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">solely for its original purpose</a>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it emerged in June that the Trump administration has built a central database of all US citizens. According to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>, the White House plans to use the new platform during upcoming elections to verify the identity and citizenship status of US voters. The database was built by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Governmental Efficiency and is being rolled out in phases to US states.</p>\n<h2>DOGE</h2>\n<p>Probably the biggest ungotten scoop of 2025 is the inside story of what happened to all of the personal, financial and other sensitive data that was accessed by workers at the so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE). President Trump tapped <strong>Elon Musk</strong> to lead the newly created department, which was mostly populated by current and former employees of Musk&#8217;s various technology companies (including <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a former denizen of the cybercrime community known as the &#8220;Com&#8221;</a>). It soon emerged that the DOGE team was using artificial intelligence <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">to surveil at least one federal agency&#8217;s communications</a> for hostility to Mr. Trump and his agenda.</p>\n<p>DOGE employees were able to access and synthesize data taken from a large number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previously separate</a> and highly guarded federal databases, including those at the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. DOGE staffers did so largely by circumventing or dismantling security measures designed to detect and prevent misuse of federal databases, including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For example, an IT expert with the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/doge-workers-code-supports-nlrb-whistleblower/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alleges</a> that DOGE employees likely downloaded gigabytes of data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts that were configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from addresses in Russia, which attempted to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.</p>\n<p>The stated goal of DOGE was to reduce bureaucracy and to massively cut costs &#8212; mainly by eliminating funding for a raft of federal initiatives that had already been approved by Congress. The DOGE website claimed those efforts reduced &#8220;wasteful&#8221; and &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; federal spending by more than $200 billion. However, multiple independent reviews by news organizations determined the true &#8220;savings&#8221; DOGE achieved was off by a couple of orders of magnitude, and was likely closer to $2 billion.</p>\n<p>At the same time DOGE was slashing federal programs, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/inspectors-general-fired-by-trump-issue-warning-about-lack-of-oversight\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fired at least 17 inspectors general</a> at federal agencies &#8212; the very people tasked with actually identifying and stopping waste, fraud and abuse at the federal level. Those included several agencies (such as the NLRB) that had open investigations into one or more of Mr. Musk&#8217;s companies for allegedly failing to comply with protocols aimed at protecting state secrets. In September, a federal judge found the president <a href=\"https://federalnewsnetwork.com/agency-oversight/2025/09/trump-unlawfully-fired-17-agency-igs-judge-finds-but-wont-reinstate-them/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlawfully fired the agency watchdogs</a>, but none of them have been reinstated.</p>\n<p>Where is DOGE now? <strong>Reuters</strong> reported last month that as far as the White House is concerned, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-doesnt-exist-with-eight-months-left-its-charter-2025-11-23/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DOGE no longer exists</a>, even though it technically has more than half a year left to its charter. Meanwhile, who exactly retains access to federal agency data that was fed by DOGE into AI tools is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher <a href=\"https://natinfosec.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NatInfoSec</a> for assisting with the research on this story.</p>"

Image: Infoblox.</p></div>\n<p>When Internet users try to visit expired domain names or accidentally navigate to a lookalike &#8220;typosquatting&#8221; domain, they are typically brought to a placeholder page at a domain parking company that tries to monetize the wayward traffic by displaying links to a number of third-party websites that have paid to have their links shown.</p>\n<p>A decade ago, ending up at one of these parked domains came with a relatively small chance of being redirected to a malicious destination: In 2014, researchers <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-alrwais.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> (PDF) that parked domains redirected users to malicious sites less than five percent of the time &#8212; regardless of whether the visitor clicked on any links at the parked page.</p>\n<p>But in a series of experiments over the past few months, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> say they discovered the situation is now reversed, and that malicious content is by far the norm now for parked websites.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;In large scale experiments, we found that over 90% of the time, visitors to a parked domain would be directed to illegal content, scams, scareware and anti-virus software subscriptions, or malware, as the &#8216;click&#8217; was sold from the parking company to advertisers, who often resold that traffic to yet another party,&#8221; Infoblox researchers wrote in <a href=\"https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/parked-domains-become-weapons-with-direct-search-advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a paper published today</a>.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found parked websites are benign if the visitor arrives at the site using a virtual private network (VPN), or else via a non-residential Internet address. For example, <strong>Scotiabank.com</strong> customers who accidentally mistype the domain as <strong>scotaibank[.]com</strong> will see a normal parking page if they&#8217;re using a VPN, but will be redirected to a site that tries to foist scams, malware or other unwanted content if coming from a residential IP address. Again, this redirect happens just by visiting the misspelled domain with a mobile device or desktop computer that is using a residential IP address.</p>\n<p>According to Infoblox, the person or entity that owns scotaibank[.]com has a portfolio of nearly 3,000 lookalike domains, including <strong>gmai[.]com</strong>, which demonstrably has been configured with its own mail server for accepting incoming email messages. Meaning, if you send an email to a Gmail user and accidentally omit the &#8220;l&#8221; from &#8220;gmail.com,&#8221; that missive doesn&#8217;t just disappear into the ether or produce a bounce reply: It goes straight to these scammers. The report notices this domain also has been leveraged in multiple recent business email compromise campaigns, using a lure indicating a failed payment with trojan malware attached.</p>\n<p>Infoblox found this particular domain holder (betrayed by a common DNS server &#8212; torresdns[.]com) has set up typosquatting domains targeting dozens of top Internet destinations, including <strong>Craigslist</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Wikipedia</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, <strong>TripAdvisor</strong>, <strong>Yahoo</strong>, <strong>eBay</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong>. A defanged list of these typosquatting domains is <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/torresdns.txt\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available here</a> (the dots in the listed domains have been replaced with commas).<span id=\"more-72848\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>David Brunsdon</strong>, a threat researcher at Infoblox, said the parked pages send visitors through a chain of redirects, all while profiling the visitor&#8217;s system using IP geolocation, device fingerprinting, and cookies to determine where to redirect domain visitors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was often a chain of redirects &#8212; one or two domains outside the parking company &#8212; before threat arrives,&#8221; Brunsdon said. &#8220;Each time in the handoff the device is profiled again and again, before being passed off to a malicious domain or else a decoy page like Amazon.com or Alibaba.com if they decide it&#8217;s not worth targeting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brunsdon said domain parking services claim the search results they return on parked pages are designed to be relevant to their parked domains, but that almost none of this displayed content was related to the lookalike domain names they tested.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_72862\" style=\"width: 757px;\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank.png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-72862\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/scotaibank.png\" width=\"747\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-72862\">Samples of redirection paths when visiting scotaibank dot com. Each branch includes a series of domains observed, including the color-coded landing page. Image: Infoblox.</p></div>\n<p>Infoblox said a different threat actor who owns <strong>domaincntrol[.]com</strong> &#8212; a domain that differs from GoDaddy&#8217;s name servers by a single character &#8212; has long taken advantage of typos in DNS configurations to drive users to malicious websites. In recent months, however, Infoblox discovered the malicious redirect only happens when the query for the misconfigured domain comes from a visitor who is using Cloudflare&#8217;s DNS resolvers (1.1.1.1), and that all other visitors will get a page that refuses to load.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that even variations on well-known government domains are being targeted by malicious ad networks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;When one of our researchers tried to report a crime to the FBI’s <strong>Internet Crime Complaint Center</strong> (IC3), they accidentally visited ic3[.]org instead of ic3[.]gov,&#8221; the report notes. &#8220;Their phone was quickly redirected to a false &#8216;Drive Subscription Expired&#8217; page. They were lucky to receive a scam; based on what we’ve learnt, they could just as easily receive an information stealer or trojan malware.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Infoblox report emphasizes that the malicious activity they tracked is not attributed to any known party, noting that the domain parking or advertising platforms named in the study were not implicated in the malvertising they documented.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, the report concludes that while the parking companies claim to only work with top advertisers, the traffic to these domains was frequently sold to affiliate networks, who often resold the traffic to the point where the final advertiser had no business relationship with the parking companies.</p>\n<p>Infoblox also pointed out that recent policy changes by <strong>Google</strong> may have inadvertently increased the risk to users from direct search abuse. Brunsdon said <strong>Google Adsense</strong> previously defaulted to allowing their ads to be placed on parked pages, but that in early 2025 Google implemented a default setting that had their customers <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/google-ads-to-remove-parked-domain-placements-by-default/ar-AA1zwYcS?apiversion=v2&amp;noservercache=1&amp;domshim=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1#:~:text=drives%20up%20CPCs-,Google%20Ads%20is%20making%20a%20major%20change%20to%20its%20Search,actively%20developed%2C%20starting%20March%2019.&amp;text=SmartAsset-,Details:,their%20account's%20Content%20suitability%20settings\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opt-out by default</a> on presenting ads on parked domains &#8212; requiring the person running the ad to voluntarily go into their settings and turn on parking as a location.</p>"

According to <strong>Satnam Narang</strong> at <strong>Tenable</strong>, this year marks the second consecutive year that Microsoft patched over one thousand vulnerabilities, and the third time it has done so since its inception.</p>\n<p>The zero-day flaw patched today is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62221\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62221</a>, a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting <strong>Windows 10</strong> and later editions. The weakness resides in a component called the &#8220;<strong>Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver</strong>&#8221; &#8212; a system driver that enables cloud applications to access file system functionalities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is particularly concerning, as the mini filter is integral to services like OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud, and remains a core Windows component, even if none of those apps were installed,&#8221; said <strong>Adam Barnett</strong>, lead software engineer at <strong>Rapid7</strong>.</p>\n<p>Only three of the flaws patched today earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating: Both <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62554\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62554</a> and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62557\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62557</a> involve <strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, and both can exploited merely by viewing a booby-trapped email message in the Preview Pane. Another critical bug &#8212; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62562\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62562</a> &#8212; involves <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong>, although Redmond says the Preview Pane is not an attack vector with this one.<span id=\"more-72782\"></span></p>\n<p>But according to Microsoft, the vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited from this month&#8217;s patch batch are other (non-critical) privilege escalation bugs, including:</p>\n<p>&#8211;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62458\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62458</a> &#8212; Win32k<br />\n&#8211;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62470\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62470</a> &#8212; Windows Common Log File System Driver<br />\n&#8211;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62472\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-62472</a> &#8212; Windows Remote Access Connection Manager<br />\n&#8211;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59516\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-59516</a> &#8212; Windows Storage VSP Driver<br />\n&#8211;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59517\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-59517</a> &#8212; Windows Storage VSP Driver</p>\n<p><strong>Kev Breen</strong>, senior director of threat research at <strong>Immersive</strong>, said privilege escalation flaws are observed in almost every incident involving host compromises.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know why Microsoft has marked these specifically as more likely, but the majority of these components have historically been exploited in the wild or have enough technical detail on previous CVEs that it would be easier for threat actors to weaponize these,&#8221; Breen said. &#8220;Either way, while not actively being exploited, these should be patched sooner rather than later.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting vulnerabilities patched this month is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-64671\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-64671</a>, a remote code execution flaw in the <strong>Github Copilot Plugin for Jetbrains</strong> AI-based coding assistant that is used by Microsoft and GitHub. Breen said this flaw would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking the large language model (LLM) into running commands that bypass the user&#8217;s &#8220;auto-approve&#8221; settings.</p>\n<p>CVE-2025-64671 is part of a broader, more systemic security crisis that security researcher <strong>Ari Marzuk</strong> has branded <a href=\"https://maccarita.com/posts/idesaster/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">IDEsaster</a> (IDE  stands for &#8220;integrated development environment&#8221;), which encompasses more than 30 separate vulnerabilities reported in nearly a dozen market-leading AI coding platforms, including <strong>Cursor</strong>, <strong>Windsurf</strong>, <strong>Gemini CLI</strong>, and <strong>Claude Code</strong>.</p>\n<p>The other publicly-disclosed vulnerability patched today is <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-54100\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2025-54100</a>, a remote code execution bug in <strong>Windows Powershell</strong> on Windows Server 2008 and later that allows an unauthenticated attacker to run code in the security context of the user.</p>\n<p>For anyone seeking a more granular breakdown of the security updates Microsoft pushed today, check out the roundup at the <a href=\"https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20December%202025/32550\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SANS Internet Storm Center</a>.

We really appreciate how they left all the electronics exposed to see what makes the conversion tick.</p>\n<p>The faux battery was made by a foam sculptor friend out of urethane foam shaped with a carving knife and then painted. It slides on a set of unistrut trolleys and reveals the 5 salvaged Tesla battery modules that power the vehicle.

The computers they&#8217;re attached to are getting up there in age, though, and although these displays are still functional it isn&#8217;t quite as straightforward to use them outside of their Apple-approved use. <a href=\"https://davidigreen.com/blog/transforming-a-2014-5k-imac-into-an-external-monitor\" target=\"_blank\">[David] demonstrates one way of getting this done by turning a 5k iMac into an external monitor.</a></p>\n<p>The first attempt at getting a usable monitor from the old iMac was something called a Luna Display, but this didn&#8217;t have a satisfying latency. Instead, [David] turned to replacing the LCD driver board with a model called the R1811. This one had a number of problems including uneven backlighting, so he tried a second, less expensive board called the T18. This one only has 8-bit color instead of the 10-bit supported by the R1811 but [David] couldn&#8217;t personally tell the difference, and since it solved the other issues with the R1811 he went with this one. After mounting the new driver board and routing all of the wires, he also replaced the webcam with an external Logitech model and upgraded the speakers as well.</p>\n<p>Even when counting the costs for both driver boards, the bill for this conversion comes in well under the cost of a new monitor of comparable quality from Apple, a company less concerned about innovation these days than overcharging their (admittedly willing) customers. For just a bit of effort, though, these older iMacs and other similar Apple machines with 5k displays can be repurposed to something relatively modern and still usable. <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2024/09/10/rescuing-high-res-displays-from-older-macs/\">Others have done similar projects and funded the upgrades by selling off the old parts</a>.</p>"

Raspberry Pi has decided to introduce a dual RAM variant of the Raspberry Pi 4 to allow DRAM supply chain flexibility along with manufacturing process improvement using intrusive reflow soldering. As you may remember, Raspberry Pi first increased the price of most Raspberry Pi 4/5 boards last December while launching the Raspberry Pi 5 1GB RAM to offer a $45 option. At the end of last month, we noted broad market price adjustments due to not only RAM prices, but also storage devices, SoCs, and other components. A few days ago, Raspberry Pi had to further increase the price of the Raspberry Pi 4/5 for the 2GB to 16GB RAM models as follows: 1GB – unchanged 2GB – +$10 4GB – +$15 8GB – +$30 16GB – +$60 It&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility that we may end up in a situation where [...]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cnx-software.com/2026/02/05/raspberry-pi-4-dual-ram-variant-introduced-to-mitigate-ram-price-increases-and-supply-challenges/\">Raspberry Pi 4 dual RAM variant introduced to mitigate RAM price increases and supply challenges</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cnx-software.com\">CNX Software - Embedded Systems News</a>.</p>"

The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2027, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other conditions. Silicon Labs wireless chips are fairly popular in Smart Home applications with Zigbee, Thread, and Matter connectivity, as well as low-power Bluetooth LE wearables and industrial Sub-GHz or 2.4 GHz IoT applications. I can still remember when Silicon Labs purchased Energy Micro in 2013, taking over the EFM32 Gecko MCU family, and about 13 years later, the company is changing hands again. Texas Instruments explains the rationale behind the solution as follows: The acquisition will create a global leader in embedded wireless connectivity solutions by combining Silicon Labs&#8217; strong portfolio and expertise in mixed signal solutions with Texas Instruments&#8217; leading analog and embedded processing portfolio and internally owned technology and [...]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cnx-software.com/2026/02/05/texas-instruments-to-acquire-silicon-labs/\">Texas Instruments to acquire Silicon Labs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cnx-software.com\">CNX Software - Embedded Systems News</a>.</p>",

The original radio had a chassis that was just as likely as not to become energized, with the only protection being the plastic housing. [David] set up an isolation transformer with a modern polarized power cable to help solve this issue, and then got to work replacing ancient capacitors. With a few other minor issues squared away this is all it took to get the radio working to receive AM radio, and he also was able to make a small modification to allow the radio to accept audio via a 3.5mm jack as well.</p>\n<p>However, [David] also has the view that a period-correct AM transmission should accompany this radio as well and set about with the second bit of this project. It&#8217;s an adaptation of a project called FieldStation42 originally meant to replicate the experience of cable TV, but [Shane], the project&#8217;s creator, helped [David] get it set up for audio as well. A notable feature of this system is that when the user tunes away from one station, it isn&#8217;t simply paused, but instead allowed to continue playing as if real time is passing in the simulated radio world.</p>\n<p>Although there are a few modern conveniences here for safety and for period-correct immersion, we think this project really hits the nail on the head for preserving everything possible while not rolling the dice with 40s-era safety standards. There&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://github.com/davidg5678/RadioTimeMachine?tab=readme-ov-file\" target=\"_blank\">a GitHub page</a> with some more info that [David] hopes to add to in the near future. <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2019/12/09/restoring-a-1949-golden-throat-radio/\">This restoration of a radio only one year newer has a similar feel</a>, and <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2014/09/09/welcome-to-the-old-school-restoring-antique-radios/\">there are also guides for a more broad category of radio restorations</a> as well.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-914183\"></span></p>\n<p></p>"

But helium&#8217;s colorless and odorless non-reactivity also means traditional gas sensing methods don&#8217;t work. Specialized detectors exist, but are expensive and fussy. Thankfully, researcher [Li Fan] and colleagues found <a href=\"https://physicsworld.com/a/new-sensor-uses-topological-material-to-detect-helium-leaks/\" target=\"_blank\">a physics-based method of detecting helium</a> that seems as elegant as it is simple.</p>\n<p>The new sensor relies on a topological <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2018/03/25/quantum-electric-material-borrows-from-japanese-basketweaving/\">kagome</a> structure, and doesn&#8217;t depend on any chemical reaction or process whatsoever. The cylinders in the structure are interconnected; air can flow in and speakers at the three corners inject sound.</p>\n<p>Sound waves propagate through the air within the structure at a fixed rate, and as helium enters the sensor it changes how fast the sound waves travel. This measurable shift in vibration frequency indicates the concentration of helium. It&#8217;s stable, calibration-free, doesn&#8217;t care much about temperature, and resets quickly. Even better, the three corners act as separate sensors, making it directional. It&#8217;s even quite rugged. Just as a basket weaved in a kagome pattern is stable and resistant to damage or imperfections in the individual strips that make up the pattern, so too is this sensor only marginally affected by physical defects.</p>\n<p>The sensor design has been tested and shown to work with helium, but could possibly be applied to other gases. More detail is <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/398757055_A_sensor_for_helium_leakage_detection_and_orientation_based_on_a_two-dimensional_acoustic_topological_material\" target=\"_blank\">available at ResearchGate</a>, with some <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article-abstract/127/24/243503/3374773/A-sensor-for-helium-leakage-detection-and\" target=\"_blank\">information about the math</a> behind it all in a supplemental paper.</p>"

        "content": "Agentic workforce is scaling faster than identity and security frameworks can adapt\nSEATTLE – Feb. 5, 2026 –\nThe latest survey report from the\nCloud Security Alliance (CSA)\n, the world’s leading not-for-profit organization committed to AI, cloud, and Zero Trust cybersecurity education, has found that while organizations are eager to harness the efficiencies brought about by AI agents, traditional human-centric Identity and Access Management (IAM) architectures aren’t capable of keeping up with agentic behavior. According to the\nSecuring Autonomous AI Agents survey report\n, which was commissioned by\nStrata Identity\n, more than half of organizations (84%) doubted they could pass a compliance audit focused on agent behavior or access controls.\n“The agentic workforce is scaling faster than identity and security frameworks can adapt. Success in the agentic era will hinge on treating agent identity with the same rigor historically reserved for human users, enabling secure autonomy at enterprise scale,” said Hillary Baron, AVP of Research, Cloud Security Alliance.\nAmong the survey’s key findings:\nAgent adoption is expected to surge in the next 12 months\n. Whereas, 58% of organizations estimate that currently they have between 1–100 agents deployed, by this time next year, over 70% expect to be managing anywhere from dozens to hundreds—39% expect between 1–100 and another 31% expect between 101–500. These values also highlight confusion in what constitutes the definition of a truly “autonomous AI agent.”\nConfidence in IAM for Agents is low\n. Only 18% of respondents say they are “highly confident” their current IAM systems can manage agent identities effectively, while the majority express only moderate (35%) or slight (29%) confidence, and another 18% report no or uncertain confidence.\nStatic credentials and fragmented controls expose agents to risk\n. Rather than implementing purpose-built, runtime authorization aligned to agent intent and context, nearly half of organizations are extending human IAM models to govern agent behavior, resulting in mismatched privilege boundaries and unclear accountability. Forty-four percent stated they use or plan to use static API keys, while 43% reported using or planning to use username and password combinations.\nDiscovery and traceability are blind spots\n. Most enterprises are retrofitting existing tools rather than deploying purpose-built systems for agent discovery and governance,  leaving them able to see some agents some of the time, but rarely in one place or in real time. Only 21% of organizations maintain a real-time registry or inventory of their agents and less than a third (28%) can reliably trace agent actions to a human or system across all environments.\nMaturity is lagging, but investments are rising\n. Cognizant of the security and governance gaps that have been exposed as a result of AI agent adoption, 40% of organizations reported that they are increasing their overall identity and security budgets to accommodate AI agents, with 34% allocating a dedicated budget line and another 22% reallocating funds from other security areas.\n“This survey shows that enterprises are coming to realize that securing AI agents isn’t just about tweaking existing IAM processes, rather it requires rethinking identity architecture altogether. Static credentials, manual provisioning, and siloed policies can’t keep pace with the speed and autonomy of agentic systems. The future of identity must be orchestrated, contextual, and continuous, enabling real-time authentication, authorization, and auditing wherever agents operate,” said Eric Olden, Co-founder & CEO, Strata Identity.\nStrata commissioned CSA to develop a survey and report to better understand the industry’s knowledge, attitudes, and opinions regarding identity controls for autonomous AI agents. Strata financed the project and co-developed the questionnaire with CSA research analysts. The survey was conducted online by CSA in September and October 2025 and received 285 responses from IT and security professionals from organizations of various sizes and locations. CSA’s research analysts performed the data analysis and interpretation for this report.\nDownload the\nSecuring Autonomous AI Agents survey report\n.\nAbout Strata Identity\nStrata Identity enables organizations to orchestrate and modernize human and agent identities without disrupting existing infrastructure while maintaining a frictionless user experience.

        "content": "Identity Governance and Administration\n(IGA) has long been a pillar of access management. It works well for employees and contractors whose identities are anchored in HR systems, follow predictable lifecycles, and change relatively slowly. In those environments, organizations have historically been willing to accept longer deployment timelines and heavier integration work in exchange for centralized control.\nBut the identity landscape has changed.\nToday, the majority of identities operating inside modern environments are non-human: service accounts, cloud service principals, automation bots, and increasingly, autonomous AI agents. These identities operate continuously, authenticate using secrets rather than passwords, and are created dynamically by platforms, pipelines, and integrations rather than centralized workflows.\nTreating them like people introduces blind spots that governance teams can no longer afford.\n‍\nThe Fundamental Mismatch: Human Identity vs. Machine Reality\nIGA platforms were designed around a core assumption: identities represent people.\nHuman identities have clear authoritative sources, relatively stable attributes, and predictable joiner–mover–leaver events. Even when access becomes complex, there is usually enough organizational context for reviewers to reason about intent and necessity.\nNon-human identities (NHIs)\nviolate nearly all of these assumptions. They may be created ad hoc by any line of the business, initiated in cloud platforms, or generated by automation tools. Ownership is often unclear or distributed across teams. Access changes frequently as systems evolve.\nThe Joiner -> Mover -> Leaver lifecycle of a human identity simply does not apply. Attempts to force these identities into human-oriented governance models often introduce friction without clarity, requiring manual ownership assignments and review workflows that are difficult to sustain.\nWhy Is Context Critical for Governing NHIs?\nTraditional IGA models see access as a relationship between identities and resources. That abstraction works for humans because much of the necessary context already exists in business systems.\nFor NHIs,\ncontext must be derived from runtime behavior.\nNHI access events follow a common pattern: an application, service, workload, or AI agent initiates an action, authenticates using a secret, binds to an identity, and accesses a resource. None of these elements are meaningful in isolation. For NHIs, the chain of relationships is the\ncontext\n.\n‍\nWhy Don’t Access Reviews Work for Non-Human Identities?\nAccess reviews were designed to answer a human-centric question:\ndoes this person still need this access?\nFor non-human identities, the questions are different.\nIs the identity still in use? What depends on it?\nWhat data does it touch?\nWhat would break if it were changed or removed?\nWhat damage could it do if compromised?\nWho owns it and what is the business justification?\nIGA platforms typically try to answer these questions through scheduled\ncertifications\n: monthly, quarterly, or annually.\nThat cadence may satisfy audit requirements, but it does not align with least privilege or how machine access actually changes.\nDeployments, configuration updates, and automation occur continuously, not on a review schedule.\nWithout consumer and usage context, reviewers are forced to guess. The result is rubber-stamping, reviewer fatigue, and growing auditor skepticism—not because reviews are missing, but because they lack substance.\n‍\nWhat Does Continuous NHI Governance Look Like?\nNon-human identities often outnumber human users by orders of magnitude. Applying manual, human-oriented attestation processes at that scale is operationally unsustainable.\nA more effective model treats attestation as\ncontinuous validation\nrather than periodic approval. After an identity is created, governance shifts to policy-driven enforcement informed by real usage and dependency data. This includes identifying over-privileged identities, rotating credentials when risk changes, flagging unused access, and safely decommissioning identities when their consumers are retired.\nIn this model, accountability is established through observable behavior rather than forced sign-offs.\n‍\nHow Do You Govern Agentic AI Access?\nThe rise of agentic AI accelerates these challenges further. Autonomous agents can initiate actions, chain tasks, and access multiple systems without direct human oversight. Access decisions are influenced not just by identity, but by intent—what the agent is being asked to do in a given moment.\nStatic roles, attributes, and scheduled reviews cannot reason about prompts or intent. Governing these systems requires contextual, execution-time controls that extend beyond traditional identity models.",

Productivity over the past years had been skyrocketing due to increased automation, courtesy of Litton Industry&#8217;s industrial robots that among other things helped to pick parts from shelves. Unfortunately, on that day there was an issue with the automated inventory system, so Robert Williams was asked to retrieve parts manually.</p>\n<p>As he climbed into the third level of the storage rack, he was crushed from behind by the arm of one of the still active one-ton transfer vehicles, killing him instantly. It would take half an hour before his body was discovered, and many years before the manufacturer would be forced to pay damages to his estate in a settlement. He only lived to be twenty-five years old.</p>\n<p>Since Robert&#8217;s gruesome death, industrial robots have become much safer, with keep-out zones, sensors, and other safety measures. However this didn&#8217;t happen overnight; it&#8217;s worth going over some of the robot tragedies to see how we got here.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-914230\"></span></p>\n<h2>Just Following Orders</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the the most terrifying aspect about most industrial robots is that they are fairly simple machines, often just an arm containing a series of stepper motors and the electronics that strictly execute the tasks programmed into it when the manufacturing line was designed and assembled. This means a large metal arm, possibly weighing more than an adult human, that can swing and move around rapidly, with no regard for what might be in between its starting and end position unless designed with safeties in place.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914539\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Industrial_robot_accident.png\"><img alt=\"Artist's depiction of the accident involving a 34-year old US worker and an industrial robot.

Although a safety fence had been installed at this Japanese plant that would disconnect the power supply of the robot when this fence was unhooked, for some reason Kenji decided to bypass this safety feature and hop over the fence. Moments later he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/dec/09/robot-kills-factory-worker\" target=\"_blank\">would be dead</a>, crushed by the robotic arm as it accidentally was activated by Kenji while in manual mode.</p>\n<p>During the following <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/12/08/Robot-kills-man/2127376635600/\" target=\"_blank\">investigation</a> it was found that Kenji&#8217;s colleagues were unfamiliar with the robot&#8217;s controls and did not know how to turn it off by simply opening the fence. Subsequently they were unable to render him any aid and were forced to look on in horror until someone was able to power down the robot.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/85-103/\" target=\"_blank\">similar accident</a> occurred in the US in 1984, when a 34-year old operator of an automated die-cast system decided to cross the safety rail around the robot&#8217;s operating envelope to clean up some scrap metal on the floor, bypassing the interlocked access in the safety rail. In this case it wasn&#8217;t the arm that crushed the worker, but the back end, which the worker apparently had deemed to be &#8216;safe&#8217;. He had received a one-week training course in robotics three weeks prior.</p>\n<h2>Protecting Squishy Humans</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914514\" style=\"width: 250px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/industrial_robot_hazard_sign_iso_7010_style_clemenspool_wikimedia.png\"><img alt=\"ISO 7010 style warning sign for industrial robots.

The first is that industrial robots are quite expensive, which makes adding major fencing and other safety measures not much of a financial issue in comparison.</p>\n<p>The second factor is that while humans are really quite versatile, they tend to have the annoying habit of bypassing safeties despite endless briefings and drills that are designed for their own protection. Let&#8217;s call this factor &#8220;human nature&#8221;. Kenji Urada&#8217;s gruesome death is an example of this, but other industries are rife with examples too, giving agencies like the US <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Chemical_Safety_Board\" target=\"_blank\">Chemical Safety Board</a> a seemingly endless collection of safety rule violations to investigate and condense into popular YouTube videos of disaster sequences.</p>\n<p>The final, third factor that ties all of this together is that we no longer live in the early decades of the Industrial Revolution, where having a human worker getting caught with an arm between some gears, or crushed by a mechanism would only lead to some clerk rolling their eyes, crossing out a name and sending out an errand boy to post a fresh &#8216;help wanted&#8217; note.</p>\n<p>Ergo, we needed to find ways to human-proof industrial robots against humans and protect us against ourselves.</p>\n<h2>ISO 10218</h2>\n<p>Although some nations have their own standards, the overarching international standard is found in ISO 10218, currently in its 2025 update. This standard comes in two parts, <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/73933.html\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 10218-1,</a> which concerns itself with the robot&#8217;s individual parts and targets robot manufacturers, as well as <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/73934.html\" target=\"_blank\">ISO 10218-2</a>, which looks at complete systems and the integration of robots.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_914542\" style=\"width: 800px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg\"><img alt=\"Germany bakery robots for palletizing food products.

To prevent this and similar hazards, we can install plentiful of safety fencing to ensure that the squishy human cannot get within the range of the unsuspecting robot.</p>\n<p>In the case of an especially persistent human, or potentially a legitimate human maintainer or operator, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that the robot is powered down or rendered harmless in some other way. For example, the safety fence that should have prevented Kenji Urada from losing his life was designed for this, but unfortunately could be bypassed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NIOSHs_Hierarchy_of_Controls_infographic_as_SVG.svg_.png\"><img alt=\"A graphical representation of a hierarchy of controls. \" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-914553\" height=\"257\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NIOSHs_Hierarchy_of_Controls_infographic_as_SVG.svg_.png?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a>Similarly, in the case of Robert Williams there was a tag in/tag out system in place for the robotics, but Robert had not been instructed in this and apparently unaware of the dangers. Being able to bypass such safeties gets us firmly sliding down the rabbit hole of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy_of_hazard_controls\" target=\"_blank\">hierarchy of controls</a>.</p>\n<p>The most effective hazard elimination is basically that, but since the robots are rather needed, and we got no replacement for them other than forcing the humans to do all the work again, this step is no real option here.</p>\n<p>Next we can try to make robots safer, by adding intrusion detection sensors to the robot&#8217;s hazard zone, or as Amazon <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/amazon-built-an-electronic-vest-to-improve-worker-robot-interactions/\" target=\"_blank\">trialed in 2019</a> by making the squishy humans in its warehouses wear a device that alerts the robots around them on the warehouse floor of their presence without relying on either machine vision or obstacle recognition.</p>\n<p>The placing of physical barriers is next, as part of engineering controls. This effectively tries to prevent humans from wandering into the danger zone like a particularly big fly around a brightly lit up bug zapper. Theoretically by putting a sufficiently daunting barrier between the hazard and the worker will said worker not end up facing their doom.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world this would be all that it&#8217;d take to guarantee a completely safe work floor, even in the case of some distracted wandering. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t help much if said robots are sharing a warehouse floor with humans. To patch up the remaining gaps we got safety training courses as part of the administrative controls, but if these were very effective then the USCSB would already be mostly out of a job.,</p>\n<p>The final item in the hierarchy of PPE can easily be skipped in the case of industrial robots, other than perhaps steel-tipped boots, a hard-hat and safety glasses in case of dropped items and flying debris. If an industrial robot&#8217;s arm is headed your way, there&#8217;s no PPE that will save your skin.</p>\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n<p>At this point in time industrial robots are fairly safe from humans, though in the US alone between 1992 and 2015 at least 61 people died due to sharing the same physical space with such a robot or a similar unfortunate event. As the number of robots increases in industry, but also in construction and health care, the topic of safety becomes ever more important.</p>\n<p>In the case of a stationary industrial robot it&#8217;s fairly easy to just put a big, tall fence around it, lock the only gate and force anyone who absolutely needs access to beg an audience with the maintenance chief. In the case of the thousands of robots rolling around in warehouses like Amazon&#8217;s, situational awareness on the part of the robots can help them detect and avoid obstacles.</p>\n<p>As long as humans are more fragile and weaker than the robots that they find themselves working around, it&#8217;s probably reasonable to expect said humans to pay a modicum of respect to the Death Machine, as the engineers who built them can only add so many technological solutions to what ultimately ends up being a game of idiot-proofing. Because absolutely nobody would ever do these exact things to willingly endanger themselves and/or others.</p>"

However, you can go a lot further, too. [CNCDan] demonstrates this well <a href=\"https://github.com/dmcke5/Hapticpad\" target=\"_blank\">with his sleek macropad build</a>, which throws haptic feedback into the mix.</p>\n<p>The build features six programmable macro buttons, which are situated either on side of a 128&#215;64 OLED display. This setup allows the OLED screen to show icons that explain the functionality of each button. There&#8217;s also a nice large rotary knob, surrounded by 20 addressable WS2811 LEDs for visual feedback. Underneath the knob lives an an encoder, as well as a brushless motor typically used in gimbal builds, which is driven by a TMC6300 motor driver board. Everything is laced up to a Waveshare RP2040 Plus devboard which runs the show. It&#8217;s responsible for controlling the motors, reading the knob and switches, and speaking USB to the PC that it&#8217;s plugged into.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a compact device that nonetheless should prove to be a good productivity booster on the bench. We&#8217;ve featured [CNCDan&#8217;s] work before, too, <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/10/04/3d-printing-a-cheap-vr-headset/\">such as this nifty DIY VR headset</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-906481\"></span></p>\n<p></p>"

[CNCDan] demonstrates this well\nwith his sleek macropad build\n, which throws haptic feedback into the mix.\nThe build features six programmable macro buttons, which are situated either on side of a 128×64 OLED display. This setup allows the OLED screen to show icons that explain the functionality of each button. There’s also a nice large rotary knob, surrounded by 20 addressable WS2811 LEDs for visual feedback. Underneath the knob lives an an encoder, as well as a brushless motor typically used in gimbal builds, which is driven by a TMC6300 motor driver board. Everything is laced up to a Waveshare RP2040 Plus devboard which runs the show. It’s responsible for controlling the motors, reading the knob and switches, and speaking USB to the PC that it’s plugged into.\nIt’s a compact device that nonetheless should prove to be a good productivity booster on the bench. We’ve featured [CNCDan’s] work before, too,\nsuch as this nifty DIY VR headset\n.",

We now have reverse-cycle air conditioning, heat pump hot water systems, and even heat pump dryers. These home appliances have all been marketed as upgrades over simpler technologies from the past, and offer improved efficiency and performance for a somewhat-higher purchase price.</p>\n<p>Heat pumps aren&#8217;t just for the home, though. They&#8217;re becoming an increasingly important part of major public works projects, as utility providers try to do ever more with ever less energy in an attempt to save the planet. These days, heat pumps are getting bigger, and will be doing ever grander things in years to come.<span id=\"more-913999\"></span></p>\n<h2>Magical Efficiency</h2>\n<p>The heat pump is a particularly attractive tool because it has a near-mystical property that virtually no other machine does. It is capable of delivering more heat energy than the amount of electricity fed into it, appearing to effectively have an efficiency greater than unity. We&#8217;re told that thermodynamic laws mean that we can <em>never </em>get more energy out than we put in. If you put 1 kW of electrical energy into a resistive heating element, which is near 100% efficient, you should get almost 1 kW of heat out of it, but never a hair more than that. But with a heat pump, you could get 1.5 kW, or even 2 kW for your humble 1 kW input. The trick is that the heat pump is not actually a magical device that can multiply energy out of nothing. Instead, the heat pump&#8217;s trick is that it&#8217;s not <em>turning </em>your 1 kW input into heat energy. It&#8217;s using 1 kW of energy to <em>move </em>heat from one place to another. If you&#8217;re running a heat pump-based HVAC system to cool your home, for example, it might use 2 kW of electricity to pump 3 to 4 kW of heat from your lounge room and dissipate it outdoors. Since the outdoors doesn&#8217;t change much in temperature when you pump out the heat from your home, you can keep doing this pretty much all day. You can even reverse the flow if your heat pump system allows it, instead pumping heat from the outdoors into your home. This works well until temperatures get so low that there isn&#8217;t enough heat left in the outdoors to appreciably warm your house up.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914005\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beanerRefrigerator-cycle.svg_.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-914005\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beanerRefrigerator-cycle.svg_.png?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914005\">A diagram of a heat pump system.

Specifically, refrigerant enters the compressor as a low pressure and low temperature vapor. It exits as a gas at high temperature and high pressure, and is then passed through a series of condenser coils. As it passes through, it releases heat to the surrounding environment and reduces in temperature, condensing into a liquid. From there, the liquid, still under high pressure, passes through an expansion valve, which rapidly lowers the pressure and drops the temperature further. The liquid is now cold, and passes through an evaporator coil where it picks up heat from the surroundings and turns back into a low-pressure, low-temperature vapor to start the cycle again as it heads back to the compressor. This system runs your fridge, your car&#8217;s air conditioner, and is used in so many other applications where it&#8217;s desirable to make something colder or hotter as efficiently as possible. You just choose which direction you want to pump the heat and design the system accordingly. Air conditioners and fridges pump heat out of a confined space, heaters and dryers pump it in, and so on. It&#8217;s heat pumps all the way down!</p>\n<h2>Bigger Applications</h2>\n<p>Thus far, you&#8217;ve probably used many a heat pump in your daily life, whether it be for heating, cooling, or drying clothes. However, there is a new push to build ever-larger heat pumps to work on the municipal scale, rather than simply serving individual households. The hope is to make utilities more energy efficient, and thus cheaper and greener in turn, by taking advantage of the efficiency gains offered by the magic of the heat pump.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914009\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seitenansicht-Extra-original-png_Rendition1280.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-914009\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seitenansicht-Extra-original-png_Rendition1280.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914009\"><em>An earlier project saw Siemens Energy team up with MVV to install a heat pump system to supply 3,500 households with 20 megawatts of heat in Mannheim.

A pair of massive heat pump units are being constructed by MVV Energie, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts. They will deliver heat to a total of 40,000 homes via a district heating system, and will be constructed on the site of a former coal power plant. Each pump will effectively draw energy out of the massive watery heat battery that is the River Rhine, and use it to warm homes in the local area. Thankfully, the river&#8217;s capacity is large enough that drawing all that heat out of the river should only affect temperatures of the water by around 0.1 C.</p>\n<p>The Rhine project builds upon a previous effort to install a large heat-pump heating system in Mannheim, in partnership with Siemens Energy. That installation draws 7 megawatts of electricity to supply 20 megawatts of heating to the local district heating grid. Installed in 2023, it supplies the heating needs of 3,500 local households.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_914011\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/aalborg_building_picture_02.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-914011\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/aalborg_building_picture_02.jpg?w=400\" width=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-914011\">The Danish installation will use slightly smaller heat pumps, but more of them, for a combined output of 177 megawatts.

The installation of four 44 megawatt MAN Technology heat pumps will be hooked up to the existing district heating system, which is also supported by other sources including waste heat from <a href=\"https://aalborgportlandholding.com/en/sustainability/district-heating-and-cooling-in-aalborg-denmark\" target=\"_blank\">a local cement factory.</a> The benefit of using smaller individual units is that it allows some of the pumps to be shut down when heating demand is lower, as winter passes through autumn into summer.</p>\n<p>What makes these projects special is their sheer scale. Rather than being measured in the kilowatt scale like home appliances, they&#8217;re measured in the many tens of megawatts, delivering heating to entire neighborhoods instead of single homes. As it turns out, heat pumps work just fine at large scales—you just need to build them out of bigger components. Bigger compressors, bigger expansion valves, and bigger condensors and evaporators—all of these combine to let you pump enormous amounts of heat from one place to another. As utilities around the world seek ever greater efficiency in new projects, heat pumps will likely grow larger and be deployed ever more widely, seeking to take advantage of the free heat on offer in the earth, water, and air around us. After all, there&#8217;s no point dumping energy into making heat when you can just move some that&#8217;s already there!</p>"

The liquid is now cold, and passes through an evaporator coil where it picks up heat from the surroundings and turns back into a low-pressure, low-temperature vapor to start the cycle again as it heads back to the compressor. This system runs your fridge, your car’s air conditioner, and is used in so many other applications where it’s desirable to make something colder or hotter as efficiently as possible. You just choose which direction you want to pump the heat and design the system accordingly. Air conditioners and fridges pump heat out of a confined space, heaters and dryers pump it in, and so on. It’s heat pumps all the way down!\nBigger Applications\nThus far, you’ve probably used many a heat pump in your daily life, whether it be for heating, cooling, or drying clothes. However, there is a new push to build ever-larger heat pumps to work on the municipal scale, rather than simply serving individual households. The hope is to make utilities more energy efficient, and thus cheaper and greener in turn, by taking advantage of the efficiency gains offered by the magic of the heat pump.\nAn earlier project saw Siemens Energy team up with MVV to install a heat pump system to supply 3,500 households with 20 megawatts of heat in Mannheim. The new installation will be almost an order of magnitude larger. Credit:\nSiemens\nAt 82.5 megawatts each, the new installation features what are perhaps the largest heat pumps in the world. Credit:\nMVV\nOne such project is taking place\njust off the River Rhine in Germany\n. A pair of massive heat pump units are being constructed by MVV Energie, each with a capacity of 82.5 megawatts. They will deliver heat to a total of 40,000 homes via a district heating system, and will be constructed on the site of a former coal power plant. Each pump will effectively draw energy out of the massive watery heat battery that is the River Rhine, and use it to warm homes in the local area. Thankfully, the river’s capacity is large enough that drawing all that heat out of the river should only affect temperatures of the water by around 0.1 C.\nThe Rhine project builds upon a previous effort to install a large heat-pump heating system in Mannheim, in partnership with Siemens Energy. That installation draws 7 megawatts of electricity to supply 20 megawatts of heating to the local district heating grid. Installed in 2023, it supplies the heating needs of 3,500 local households.\nThe Danish installation will use slightly smaller heat pumps, but more of them, for a combined output of 177 megawatts. Credit:\nMAN Technology\nA similar project is underway in Denmark, which will supply 177 megawatts of heat to homes in Aalborg. The installation of four 44 megawatt MAN Technology heat pumps will be hooked up to the existing district heating system, which is also supported by other sources including waste heat from\na local cement factory.\nThe benefit of using smaller individual units is that it allows some of the pumps to be shut down when heating demand is lower, as winter passes through autumn into summer.\nWhat makes these projects special is their sheer scale. Rather than being measured in the kilowatt scale like home appliances, they’re measured in the many tens of megawatts, delivering heating to entire neighborhoods instead of single homes. As it turns out, heat pumps work just fine at large scales—you just need to build them out of bigger components. Bigger compressors, bigger expansion valves, and bigger condensors and evaporators—all of these combine to let you pump enormous amounts of heat from one place to another. As utilities around the world seek ever greater efficiency in new projects, heat pumps will likely grow larger and be deployed ever more widely, seeking to take advantage of the free heat on offer in the earth, water, and air around us. After all, there’s no point dumping energy into making heat when you can just move some that’s already there!",

During the meeting, EPO VP for Legal and International Affairs Christoph Ernst and ETSI Director-General Jan Ellsberger signed a renewed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and a 3-year Workplan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A forward-looking framework for innovation</strong></p>\n<p>In his opening remarks, EPO VP for Legal and International Affairs Christoph Ernst underlined that the renewed MoU reflects the EPO’s commitment under its Strategic Plan 2028 to building future-oriented partnerships that enhance transparency, quality and digital transformation across the global innovation ecosystem. He noted that the link between patents and standards is increasingly vital for Europe’s competitiveness in rapidly evolving fields such as 6G, artificial intelligence, quantum and clean technologies.<br />“The EPO and ETSI stand at the crossroads of technology and regulation,” the VP for Legal and International Affairs&nbsp;said. “Our co-operation ensures that fresh ideas can flourish – built on reliable standards, transparent patent information and the participatory processes that underpin Europe’s innovation system.”</p>\n<p><strong>Connecting patents and standards for quality and transparency</strong></p>\n<p>The renewed agreement reaffirms the EPO’s long-standing access to ETSI standards and working documents, which are essential sources of non-patent literature in patent examination.

This follows the <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/newsroom/news/2517-etsi-and-tta-renew-co-operation-agreement-strengthening-digital-partnership-between-eu-and-south-korea\">renewal</a> of their cooperation agreement in March 2025.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"jan on stage gisc 2025 2\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://www.etsi.org/images/News/2025/jan-on-stage-gisc-2025-2.jpg\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; float: left;\" width=\"436\" />In his keynote speech, “<em>Global ICT Standards for a Sustainable and Trustworthy Digital Future</em>” Mr. Ellsberger reaffirmed ETSI’s commitment to global collaboration and highlighted Europe’s role in shaping an open, inclusive, and consensus-driven standards ecosystem. With over 950 members and 35 years of experience, ETSI continues to bridge European excellence and international standardisation efforts in areas such as 6G, AI, cybersecurity, quantum technologies, and trusted data frameworks. He emphasised that diversity across technologies, contributors, and regions drives innovation, resilience, and security in 6G and AI, while open standards from ETSI and 3GPP promote fair competition, rapid adoption, and “<strong>AI for All</strong>.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr. Scott Cadzow, Chair of ETSI’s <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/committee/technical-committee-tc-securing-artificial-intelligence-sai\">Technical Committee Securing Artificial Intelligence (TC SAI)</a>, spoke at the Global Standards Strategy Seminar I (AI), presenting ETSI’s perspective on <strong>Physical AI and Standardisation</strong> to secure and assure the safe use of AI. He outlined six years of progress and future priorities.</p>\n<p><strong>ETSI’s Key Contributions to AI Standardisation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since 2019, ETSI has supported the safe and secure use of AI through robust standards. The creation of ISG SAI addressed the lack of common understanding around AI threats with AI as a system in its own right; a component of a system; an adversarial attacker; and, as a system defender. It laid the groundwork for a rational, evidence-based narrative accessible to both technical experts and broader audiences.</li>\n<li>ETSI’s methodology follows a clear path: problem identification, solution research, and solution specification. This approach ensures that mitigation strategies evolve alongside AI technologies—from Machine Learning to Generative, Agentic, and General AI.</li>\n<li>Through ETSI’s methodology, its members are guided by ETSI’s Directives, codes of conduct and other frameworks that ensure consensus is built without dispute. Ethical considerations are embedded in ETSI’s standards work, though not explicitly defined. Standards must be necessary, unambiguous, complete, precise, well-structured, consistent, and testable - criteria that make defining “ethical AI” in a standardisation context particularly challenging.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestones in ETSI’s AI activity:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2019–2023:</strong> ISG SAI published no less than 9 reports, including the AI Threat Ontology, Mitigation Strategy, and Data Supply Chain Security.</li>\n<li><strong>2024–2025:</strong> TC SAI, created in 2023, accelerated output with 17 publications in its first two years, covering topics such as AI model traceability, privacy, explicability, and cybersecurity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Establishing a Baseline for AI Security:</strong></p>\n<p>ETSI’s latest milestone is the <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/304200_304299/304223/02.00.00_20/en_304223v020000a.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">publication</a> of a baseline for AI Security titled “Baseline Cyber Security Requirements for AI Models and Systems”, addressing core principles across five lifecycle phases: Design, Development, Deployment, Maintenance, and End-of-Life.

        "content": "Matter\nNews\nThread\n28th January 2026\nThe Editor\n0 Comments\n2 min read\nYale\nhas (finally) expanded its Linus smart lock family with the\nLinus® L2 Lite\n, a\nMatter-enabled\nsmart door lock designed for simple installation and broad smart home compatibility. The lock was originally announced\nback in September\nof last year, and was due for release in December, but was slightly delayed.\nPositioned as an accessible entry point to connected access control, the L2 Lite combines keyless convenience with support for major ecosystems including\nApple Home\n,\nGoogle Home\n,\nAmazon\nAlexa\n, and\nSamsung SmartThings\n.\nUnlike some full-deadbolt replacements, the Linus L2 Lite installs on the inside of existing doors and works with common cylinder types, including Euro-profile and compatible round cylinders, without requiring drilling or professional help. This design enables retrofit upgrades in apartments or houses with minimal disruption to existing hardware.\nThe lock uses\nMatter over Thread\nalong with Bluetooth 5.0 for local control and integration, allowing users to operate the lock through their preferred smart home platform once paired with a Matter controller. Remote access and cloud-based features can be enabled via a Wi-Fi bridge accessory.\nKEY FEATURES\nKeyless control and Auto-Unlock\n: Lock or unlock the door using the Yale Home app, with hands-free Auto-Unlock that opens the door when the phone is detected nearby, reducing the need for physical keys.\nKeySense™ button\n: A manual button on the lock allows simple locking or unlocking from the inside, offering a fallback method without a phone.\nDigital\nKeys and access sharing\n: The Yale Home app can issue digital keys or PIN codes to family, friends, or service providers, with activity logging and easy revocation of access.\nSmart home integration\n: Matter compatibility enables control from Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings, including automation and voice control once integrated.\nThe L2 Lite is battery powered, using a CR123A, with battery life estimates up to six months under typical use patterns. Its compact form factor and simple install process are aimed at renters or homeowners who want to upgrade door access without replacing the entire lock mechanism.\nPOSITIONING & COMPATIBILITY\nBy adopting Matter over Thread, the Yale Linus L2 Lite addresses one of the major hurdles in smart home deployments – ecosystem fragmentation – with native support across the leading platforms. However, full remote features still depend on optional accessories such as a Wi-Fi bridge when using it solely within Yale’s own ecosystem, and local Matter controllers or hubs are required for Apple Home and other integrations.\nThe Linus L2 Lite sits below more fully featured smart deadbolts in Yale’s range but offers a balanced feature set for everyday users seeking keyless access, shared digital entry, and smart automation without complex installation.\nThe Yale Linus L2 Lite is available now on\nAmazon.co.uk\n,\nAmazon.de\n,\nAmazon.fr\n, and\nAmazon.it",

It’s for a smart-home standard called Matter, and it looks like this:\nMatter\nI am aware that one of the surest cures for insomnia is an earnest person explaining technical protocols and standards in fine-grained detail. So in the spirit of self-awareness, I ask you to accept these tl;dr bullets, with the hope that you may stick around to learn about the tech behind this increasingly common and influential smart-home standard.\nMatter is the smart-home industry’s solution for smoothing out the smart-home experience. It’s intended to make devices easier to set up, more compatible with one another, and more secure.\nMatter isn’t something you use or even have to think about — it’s just a set of technical agreements that guide how the devices you buy can function.\nMatter is often paired with another wireless tech, Thread (in an arrangement dubbed Matter over Thread), which enables far more reliable short-range connections for devices in your home, interconnection across them all, and very long battery life.\nMatter devices need to connect to a hub, which enables communication with other Matter devices as well as remote access to them via the internet. (Most smart speakers are Matter-hub-capable.)\nIf you are still here and curious about what benefits Matter offers (and what pitfalls it involves), read on.\nWhat Matter is\nBuying a smart gadget has always entailed an element of the unknown: Will this thing actually work? And will it work with your other stuff?\nThat is in part the inspiration for Matter. Launched in 2022, Matter is a technical standard for connecting smart devices, developed by a\nwho’s who of tech’s biggest players\n.\nPrior to Matter, it was common to buy a smart-home device, such as a thermostat or light bulb, set it up, and control it using its companion smartphone app. If you then got a device from another brand, it too would have its own app. Repeat that a few times, and you’d quickly have all those smart devices as well as a smartphone home screen chock-full of apps but potentially no easy way to have all your devices work together — which is kind of the opposite of the intent of a smart home.\nA solution, in part, came with the advent of devices called smart hubs, which plugged into your home Wi-Fi router and could theoretically consolidate all the controls of your smart devices into just a single app.\nThen hubs were largely superseded by the arrival of\nsmart speakers\n, like those from Amazon, Apple, and Google. Not only did smart speakers allow you to control devices by using voice commands, but they also acted as smart hubs that let you control third-party devices from a range of companies. And their companion smartphone apps allowed you to consolidate controls across lots of devices.\nA big problem remained, though: Some devices might be compatible with one of those platforms but not others, so you still had devices that couldn’t work with each other. Or you might set up devices with one ecosystem but want to switch it later and be unable to. There was no easy way to vet the security or reliability of smart devices, and you might encounter a confusing array of setup methods. Once again the smart home was fractured.\nA Matter network requires a hub, such as a smart speaker, and makes devices compatible with one another and controllable through your pick of popular apps.\nNYT Wirecutter\nMatter represents the industry’s plan to fix that issue. A consortium of 200-plus companies all agreed on a set of technical and connectivity standards that would enable devices to be fully compatible with one another, as well as the control apps for smart speakers. To earn Matter certification, device makers also have to employ rigorous security practices. And, at least officially, Matter devices are supposed to be controllable locally in your home — meaning, if your internet service goes down, or if you simply prefer not to have your devices exposed to the internet at all, you should still be able to control and use them while you are at home. (So far this hasn’t always been the case, though; see below.) And if you change your mind and want to switch from Apple Home to Alexa or Google, for example, you should be able to without a hitch.\nIn order to make all of that possible, you typically need a Matter device to act as a hub, handling communications with all the devices on your home network — fortunately, most all\nAmazon, Apple, and Google Nest smart speakers\n, which are popular and already in many homes, are Matter hubs. Your other Matter-enabled devices connect to your hub through a variety of wireless methods, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\nAchieving this interconnectivity is a monumental task in part because there are many hundreds of companies in the smart-home world, and so Matter was launched with the idea that over time more and more categories of devices and capabilities would be included in periodic updates. For instance, some device types, such as security cameras, weren’t certified for Matter until 2025.\nWhere Matter still falls short\nOur experience in using Matter-enabled devices is that even with steady updates it continues to be maddeningly nonuniform.\nBut there’s hope. As the consortium first promised, Matter has indeed kept up the pace of improvement with a consistent release schedule a couple of times per year; one usually introduces new device types and capabilities, the other usually fixes bugs and stability. For instance, last fall a number of device types joined the roster, including dishwashers, refrigerators, and robot vacuums. And at the CES 2026 trade show in January, Matter compatibility with this year’s crop of smart-home devices was widespread. All of this is both encouraging and laudable.\nAnd many shortcomings that were common in the first year or two of Matter’s wide release have been addressed, as well — setting up new Matter devices is generally fast and more streamlined, for instance.\nBut as much as things have progressed, Matter still feels very much like a work in progress, which makes it hard to recommend for a non-technical buyer. This is in large part because device manufacturers aren’t all on the same track. It turns out that they aren’t required to adopt all the features available in a given Matter update, or any update at all.\nFor instance, some devices automatically connect as Matter devices in an instant and are readily usable on multiple platforms; this has been our experience with Aqara devices, for example. But some devices may support control by only one smart platform at a time — that’s not totally unreasonable, but for some homes it presents a hitch, and it’s not what Matter promised. And while you are supposed to be able to control a Matter device locally, meaning without a connection to the internet, that\njust isn’t the case for many devices\n. As a buyer it’s not easy to tell what you’re getting, which is not how it’s supposed to be.\nAs an illustration of failed expectations, I intended to test the newest\nYale Smart Lock with Matter\n, and so I installed the lock and used the Yale Access app to set it up. But then I realized that because it doesn’t directly connect to Wi-Fi, I would need to connect it to a Matter hub, such as a smart speaker. And to do that I’d have to factory-reset the lock and start over. Also, this lock can connect to only one Matter app at a time, and each Matter connection requires its own distinct Matter hub, so if you use more than one app, you need a hub for each one. If you failed to understand that last sentence, you’re not alone, which is a real problem. Yale’s\ninstructions for figuring this out\nare lengthy and jargon-filled, which is a stark departure from the normal process for the smart home today of simply scanning a code to connect a device and moving on with your life.\nWe’ve also found that Matter controls may be very limited in a given app, and so the notion of relying on a single app to control your entire Matter smart home is a myth — you still need a folder filled with all the companion apps for a number of features (the Yale lock, for instance, offers different controls for each Matter app). Again, this is likely the fault of manufacturers and not Matter itself, but for most buyers that fact doesn’t, well, matter.\nHow Thread adds to Matter\nParallel to the release and development of Matter, there’s also Thread wireless, which lives on its own but also can be incorporated with Matter devices (in an arrangement dubbed, not surprisingly, Matter over Thread).\nThread devices can connect to a Matter network and also interconnect with other Thread devices, which boosts their wireless range and performance.\nNYT Wirecutter\nThread allows both plug-in and battery-powered smart devices to easily and reliably connect with one another in an energy-efficient way. (Matter over Thread devices are accessible from a Matter app.) Thread devices also form what’s called a mesh network, which means that instead of having every device connect wirelessly to a hub, they can connect to a hub or directly to each other. This cobweb of interconnections between Thread devices ensures that they stay connected while using far less power — for instance, smaller devices like sensors may have batteries that last a year or even two.\nTo use Thread devices, you need a device called a Thread Border Router, which is essentially like a second hub — it talks to the Thread devices and then connects them with your Matter network. (Unlike Matter, Thread is a type of wireless signal, just like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.) The excellent news is that most of the smart speakers that support Matter can also act as a Thread Border Router. Most Amazon Echo devices, Apple HomePod models, and Google Nest speakers support both Matter and Thread (\nhere’s a list\n).\nShould you be wary of buying Matter devices?\nThere is no drawback to having a Matter or non-Matter device in a smart-home system so long as it does what you want it to do. Since Matter and non-Matter devices should be able to continue working together going forward, we can’t see a downside to continuing to buy devices as you see fit. If you already have a smart platform you like, you will be able to use Matter and non-Matter devices at the same time with no issues.\nThis article was edited by Grant Clauser.\nMeet your\nguide\nJon Chase\nWhat I Cover\nI am an editor (and frequent writer) focused on smart-home devices and how they can make life more convenient, secure, and enjoyable.\nFurther reading\nSmart Home for Apartments and Renters\nby\nGrant Clauser\nThese smart-home devices don’t need permanent installation, so you can take them with you when you move.\nHow to Use Your Smart Lock Better\nby\nJon Chase\nYou can do way more with a smart lock than just control it with an app. Here are a few of our favorite skills to make the most of this essential smart device.\nUncle Sam Has a Plan to Secure Your Smart Home.

L'Ã©diteur indique qu'elles permettent Ã  un attaquant non authentifiÃ© de provoquer une exÃ©cution de code arbitraire Ã  distance.\nIvanti indique que les vulnÃ©rabilitÃ©s CVE-2026-1281 et CVE-2026-1340 sont activement exploitÃ©es dans le cadre d'attaques ciblÃ©es.\nRecherche de compromission\nEn cas de suspicion de compromission, l'Ã©diteur recommande  :\nd'isoler totalement les Ã©quipements EPMM et Sentry concernÃ©e du rÃ©seau, vis-Ã -vis d'Internet comme du rÃ©seau interne ;\nNote : Sentry est conÃ§u pour acheminer certains types de trafic depuis les terminaux mobiles vers le rÃ©seau interne. Si vous pensez que votre Ã©quipement EPMM est compromis, Ivanti recommande d'examiner les systÃ¨mes auxquels Sentry peut accÃ©der afin de dÃ©tecter d'Ã©ventuelles traces de reconnaissances ou de mouvements latÃ©raux.\nde rÃ©aliser un instantanÃ© ou effectuer une sauvegarde du disque ;\nde rechercher les tentatives d'exploitations dans les journaux d'accÃ¨s Apache\n/var/log/httpd/https-access_log\n.\nLes caractÃ©ristiques des requÃªtes HTTP malveillantes sont dÃ©crites ci-dessous :\nCaractÃ©ristiques HTTP\nValeur(s) Ã  rechercher\nMÃ©thode HTTP\nGET\nChemin d'accÃ¨s\n/mifs/c/aftstore/fob/\n/mifs/c/appstore/fob/\nCode HTTP\n404\nParamÃ¨tres\ncontenant des commandes bash\nLes instances d'ivanti EPMM avec le correctif de sÃ©curitÃ© appliquÃ© produiront des faux positifs suivants lors de la recherche de requÃªtes HTTP malveillantes qui ressemblent Ã  l'exemple ci-dessous :\n127.0.0.1:33354 - - 2026-01-28--12-00-01 \"GET /mifs/c/aftstore/fob/3/0/sha256:kid=0 HTTP/1.1\" 404\nDeux moyens de persistance sont connus Ã  ce jour par l'Ã©diteur :\nle dÃ©ploiement de diffÃ©rentes consoles web malveillantes\n(webshells)\n, en modifiant des pages d'erreur HTTP tel que\n401.jsp\nou en introduisant des fichiers WAR ou JAR ;\nle dÃ©ploiement d'invite de commande inverse\n(reverse shell)\n.\nToute requÃªte vers des pages d'erreur HTTP utilisant la mÃ©thode POST ou des paramÃ¨tres doit Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©e comme une suspicion de communication avec une porte dÃ©robÃ©e.\nToute connexion de longue durÃ©e initiÃ©e par un Ivanti EPMM doit Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©e comme une suspicion de communication par un invite de commande inverse.\nRemÃ©diation\nEn cas de compromission, l'Ã©diteur prÃ©conise de :\nrestaurer une sauvegarde saine d'un Ivanti EPMM [1] ;\ns'il n'est pas possible de rÃ©cupÃ©rer l'EPMM Ã  partir d'une sauvegarde, Ivanti recommande de crÃ©er un EPMM de remplacement, puis de migrer les donnÃ©es vers celui-ci ;\nrÃ©initialiser les mots de passe de tous les comptes EPMM locaux ;\nrÃ©initialiser les mots de passe de tous les comptes de service LDAP et KDC [2] ;\nrÃ©voquer et remplacer les certificats publics utilisÃ©s par l'EPMM [3] ;\nrÃ©initialiser les mots de passe de tous les comptes de service interne ou externe configurÃ© avec EPMM.\nSolutions\nL'obtention des scripts RPM correctifs 12.x.0.x et 12.x.1.x s'effectuent via le portail de tÃ©lÃ©chargement d'Ivanti.
